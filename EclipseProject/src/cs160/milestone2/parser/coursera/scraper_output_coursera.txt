Title:  Machine Learning
Short desc:  Learn about the most effective machine learning techniques, and gain practice implementing them and getting them to work for yourself.
Long desc:  <p>Machine learning is the science of getting computers to act without being
    explicitly programmed. In the past decade, machine learning has given us
    self-driving cars, practical speech recognition, effective web search,
    and a vastly improved understanding of the human genome. Machine learning
    is so pervasive today that you probably use it dozens of times a day without
    knowing it. Many researchers also think it is the best way to make progress
    towards human-level AI. In this class, you will learn about the most effective
    machine learning techniques, and gain practice implementing them and getting
    them to work for yourself. More importantly, you'll learn about not only
    the theoretical underpinnings of learning, but also gain the practical
    know-how needed to quickly and powerfully apply these techniques to new
    problems. Finally, you'll learn about some of Silicon Valley's best practices
    in innovation as it pertains to machine learning and AI.</p>
<p>This course provides a broad introduction to machine learning, datamining,
    and statistical pattern recognition. Topics include: (i) Supervised learning
    (parametric/non-parametric algorithms, support vector machines, kernels,
    neural networks). (ii) Unsupervised learning (clustering, dimensionality
    reduction, recommender systems, deep learning). (iii) Best practices in
    machine learning (bias/variance theory; innovation process in machine learning
    and AI). The course will also draw from numerous case studies and applications,
    so that you'll also learn how to apply learning algorithms to building
    smart robots (perception, control), text understanding (web search, anti-spam),
    computer vision, medical informatics, audio, database mining, and other
    areas.</p>

Title:  Probabilistic Graphical Models
Short desc:  In this class, you will learn the basics of the PGM representation and how to construct them, using both human knowledge and machine learning techniques.
Long desc:  <p><strong>What are Probabilistic Graphical Models?</strong></p>
<p>Uncertainty is unavoidable in real-world applications: we can almost never predict with certainty what will happen in the future, and even in the present and the past, many important aspects of the world are not observed with certainty. Probability theory gives us the basic foundation to model our beliefs about the different possible states of the world, and to update these beliefs as new evidence is obtained. These beliefs can be combined with individual preferences to help guide our actions, and even in selecting which observations to make. While probability theory has existed since the 17th century, our ability to use it effectively on large problems involving many inter-related variables is fairly recent, and is due largely to the development of a framework known as Probabilistic Graphical Models (PGMs). This framework, which spans methods such as Bayesian networks and Markov random fields, uses ideas from discrete data structures in computer science to efficiently encode and manipulate probability distributions over high-dimensional spaces, often involving hundreds or even many thousands of variables. These methods have been used in an enormous range of application domains, which include: web search, medical and fault diagnosis, image understanding, reconstruction of biological networks, speech recognition, natural language processing, decoding of messages sent over a noisy communication channel, robot navigation, and many more. The PGM framework provides an essential tool for anyone who wants to learn how to reason coherently from limited and noisy observations.</p>
In this class, you will learn the basics of the PGM representation and how to construct them, using both human knowledge and machine learning techniques; you will also learn algorithms for using a PGM to reach conclusions about the world from limited and noisy evidence, and for making good decisions under uncertainty. The class covers both the theoretical underpinnings of the PGM framework and practical skills needed to apply these techniques to new problems.

Title:  Cryptography I
Short desc:  Learn about the inner workings of cryptographic primitives and how to apply this knowledge in real-world applications!
Long desc:  <p>Cryptography is an indispensable tool for protecting information in computer systems. This course explains the inner workings of cryptographic primitives and how to correctly use them. Students will learn how to reason about the security of cryptographic constructions and how to apply this knowledge to real-world applications. The course begins with a detailed discussion of how two parties who have a shared secret key can communicate securely when a powerful adversary eavesdrops and tampers with traffic. We will examine many deployed protocols and analyze mistakes in existing systems. The second half of the course discusses public-key techniques that let two or more parties generate a shared secret key. We will cover the relevant number theory and discuss public-key encryption and basic key-exchange.&nbsp;Throughout the course students will be exposed to many exciting open problems in the field.</p>
<p>The course will include written homeworks and programming labs. The course is self-contained, however it will be helpful to have a basic understanding of discrete probability theory.</p>

Title:  Algorithms: Design and Analysis, Part 1
Short desc:  In this course you will learn several fundamental principles of algorithm design: divide-and-conquer methods, graph algorithms, practical data structures (heaps, hash tables, search trees), randomized algorithms, and more.
Long desc:  In this course you will learn several fundamental principles of algorithm design. You'll learn the divide-and-conquer design paradigm, with applications to fast sorting, searching, and multiplication. You'll learn several blazingly fast primitives for computing on graphs, such as how to compute connectivity information and shortest paths. Finally, we'll study how allowing the computer to "flip coins" can lead to elegant and practical algorithms and data structures. Learn the answers to questions such as: How do data structures like heaps, hash tables, bloom filters, and balanced search trees actually work, anyway? How come QuickSort runs so fast? What can graph algorithms tell us about the structure of the Web and social networks? Did my 3rd-grade teacher explain only a suboptimal algorithm for multiplying two numbers?

Title:  Model Thinking
Short desc:  In this class, you will learn how to think with models and use them to make sense of the complex world around us.
Long desc:  We live in a complex world with diverse people, firms, and governments whose behaviors aggregate to produce novel, unexpected phenomena. We see political uprisings, market crashes, and a never ending array of social trends. How do we make sense of it? Models. Evidence shows that people who think with models consistently outperform those who don't. And, moreover people who think with lots of models outperform people who use only one.
Why do models make us better thinkers?
Models help us to better organize information - to make sense of that fire hose or hairball of data (choose your metaphor) available on the Internet. Models improve our abilities to make accurate forecasts. They help us make better decisions and adopt more effective strategies. They even can improve our ability to design institutions and procedures. In this class, I present a starter kit of models: I start with models of tipping points. I move on to cover models explain the wisdom of crowds, models that show why some countries are rich and some are poor, and models that help unpack the strategic decisions of firm and politicians. The models covered in this class provide a foundation for future social science classes, whether they be in economics, political science, business, or sociology. Mastering this material will give you a huge leg up in advanced courses. They also help you in life.
Here's how the course will work.
For each model, I present a short, easily digestible overview lecture. Then, I'll dig deeper. I'll go into the technical details of the model. Those technical lectures won't require calculus but be prepared for some algebra. For all the lectures, I'll offer some questions and we'll have quizzes and even a final exam. If you decide to do the deep dive, and take all the quizzes and the exam, you'll receive a certificate of completion. If you just decide to follow along for the introductory lectures to gain some exposure that's fine too. It's all free. And it's all here to help make you a better thinker!<br><br><b>Subtitles for</b>&nbsp;<b>all video lectures available in</b>:&nbsp;Chinese (provided by&nbsp;<a href="http://coursera.yeeyan.org/" target="_blank">Yeeyan</a>),&nbsp;English,&nbsp;Ukrainian (<a href="http://pinchukfund.org/en/">Pinchuk Foundation</a>)<br>

Title:  Introduction to Databases
Short desc:  This course covers database design and the use of database management systems for applications.
Long desc:  "Introduction to Databases" had a very successful public offering in fall
2011, as one of Stanford's inaugural three massive open online courses.
Since then, the course materials have been improved and expanded, and all
materials are available for self-study. Students have access to lectures
with in-video quizzes, multiple-choice quiz assignments, automatically-checked
interactive programming exercises, midterm and final exams, a discussion
forum, optional additional exercises with solutions, and pointers to readings
and resources. Taught by Professor Jennifer Widom, the curriculum draws
from Stanford's popular Introduction to Databases course. The material
presented here is the same as the corresponding material presented on Stanford's
Class2Go platform.
<br>
<br>

<h2>Why Learn About Databases?</h2>
Databases are incredibly prevalent -- they underlie technology used by
most people every day if not every hour. Databases reside behind a huge
fraction of websites; they're a crucial component of telecommunications
systems, banking systems, video games, and just about any other software
system or electronic device that maintains some amount of persistent information.
In addition to persistence, database systems provide a number of other
properties that make them exceptionally useful and convenient: reliability,
efficiency, scalability, concurrency control, data abstractions, and high-level
query languages. Databases are so ubiquitous and important that computer
science graduates frequently cite their database class as the one most
useful to them in their industry or graduate-school careers.

Title:  Game Theory
Short desc:  The course covers the basics: representing games and strategies, the extensive form (which computer scientists call game trees), repeated and stochastic games, coalitional games, and Bayesian games (modeling things like auctions).
Long desc:  Popularized by movies such as "A Beautiful Mind", game theory is the mathematical modeling of strategic interaction among rational (and irrational) agents. Beyond what we call 'games' in common language, such as chess, poker, soccer, etc., it includes the modeling of conflict among nations, political campaigns, competition among firms, and trading behavior in markets such as the NYSE. How could you begin to model eBay, Google keyword auctions, and peer to peer file-sharing networks, without accounting for the incentives of the people using them? The course will provide the basics: representing games and strategies, the extensive form (which computer scientists call game trees), Bayesian games (modeling things like auctions), repeated and stochastic games, and more. We'll include a variety of examples including classic games and real-world applications.

Title:  Computer Science 101
Short desc:  CS101 teaches the essential ideas of Computer Science for a zero-prior-experience audience. The course uses small coding experiments in the browser to play with the nature of computers, understanding their strengths and limitations. Sign up for the "To be announced" session to be notified by email when the class is next run, and sign up for "Self-Study" to start browsing the class materials right away. Self-Study mode makes all the videos and assignments available to be done at your own pace, but without a certificate of completion at the end.
Long desc:  <p>CS101 teaches the essential ideas of Computer Science for a zero-prior-experience audience. Computers can appear very complicated, but in reality, computers work within just a few, simple patterns. CS101 demystifies and brings those patterns to life, which is useful for anyone using computers today.</p>
<p>In CS101, students play and experiment with short bits of "computer code" to bring to life to the power and limitations of computers. Everything works within the browser, so there is no extra software to download or install. CS101 also provides a general background on computers today: what is a computer, what is hardware, what is software, what is the internet. No previous experience is required other than the ability to use a web browser.</p>

Title:  Automata
Short desc:  This course covers finite automata, context-free grammars, Turing machines, undecidable problems, and intractable problems (NP-completeness).
Long desc:  <p>I am pleased to be able to offer free over the Internet a course on Automata Theory, based on the material I have taught periodically at Stanford in the course CS154. Students have access to screencast lecture videos, are given quiz questions, assignments and exams, receive regular feedback on progress, and can participate in a discussion forum. Those who successfully complete the course will receive a statement of accomplishment. You will need a decent Internet connection for accessing course materials, but should be able to watch the videos on your smartphone.</p>
The course covers four broad areas: (1) Finite automata and regular expressions, (2) Context-free grammars, (3) Turing machines and decidability, and (4) the theory of intractability, or NP-complete problems.<br><strong><br>Why Study Automata Theory?</strong><br><br>This subject is not just for those planning to enter the field of complexity theory, although it is a good place to start if that is your goal. Rather, the course will emphasize those aspects of the theory that people really use in practice. Finite automata, regular expressions, and context-free grammars are ideas that have stood the test of time. They are essential tools for compilers. But more importantly, they are used in many systems that require input that is less general than a full programming language yet more complex than "push this button."<br><br>The concepts of undecidable problems and intractable problems serve a different purpose. Undecidable problems are those for which no computer solution can ever exist, while intractable problems are those for which there is strong evidence that, although they can be solved by a computer, they cannot be solved sufficiently fast that the solution is truly useful in practice. Understanding this theory, and in particular being able to prove that a problem you are facing belongs to one of these classes, allows you to justify taking another approach — simplifying the problem or writing code to approximate the solution, for example.<br><br>During the course, I'm going to prove a number of things. The purpose of these proofs is not to torture you or confuse you. Neither are the proofs there because I doubt you would believe me were I merely to state some well-known fact. Rather, understanding how these proofs, especially inductive proofs, work, lets you think more clearly about your own work. I do not advocate proofs that programs are correct, but whenever you attempt something a bit complex, it is good to have in mind the inductive proofs that would be needed to guarantee that what you are doing really works in all cases.

Title:  Introduction to Logic
Short desc:  In this course, you will learn how to formalize information and reason systematically to produce logical conclusions. We will also examine logic technology and its applications - in mathematics, science, engineering, business, law, and so forth.
Long desc:  <p>Logic is one of the oldest intellectual disciplines in human history.
    It dates back to the times of Aristotle; it has been studied through the
    centuries; and it is still a subject of active investigation today.</p>
<p>This course is a basic introduction to Logic. It shows how to formalize
    information in form of logical sentences. It shows how to reason systematically
    with this information to produce all logical conclusions and only logical
    conclusions. And it examines logic technology and its applications - in
    mathematics, science, engineering, business, law, and so forth.</p>
<p>The course differs from other introductory courses in Logic in two important
    ways. First of all, it teaches a novel theory of logic that improves accessibility
    while preserving rigor. Second, the material is laced with interactive
    demonstrations and exercises that suggest the many practical applications
    of the field.</p>

Title:  Compilers
Short desc:  This course will discuss the major ideas used today in the implementation of programming language compilers. You will learn how a program written in a high-level language designed for humans is systematically translated into a program written in low-level assembly more suited to machines!
Long desc:  <p>This course will discuss the major ideas used today in the implementation of programming language compilers, including lexical analysis, parsing, syntax-directed translation, abstract syntax trees, types and type checking, intermediate languages, dataflow analysis, program optimization, code generation, and runtime systems. As a result, you will learn how a program written in a high-level language designed for humans is systematically translated into a program written in low-level assembly more suited to machines. Along the way we will also touch on how programming languages are designed, programming language semantics, and why there are so many different kinds of programming languages.</p>
<p>The course lectures will be presented in short videos. To help you master the material, there will be in-lecture questions to answer, quizzes, and two exams: a midterm and a final. There will also be homework in the form of exercises that ask you to show a sequence of logical steps needed to derive a specific result, such as the sequence of steps a type checker would perform to type check a piece of code, or the sequence of steps a parser would perform to parse an input string. This checking technology is the result of ongoing research at Stanford into developing innovative tools for education, and we're excited to be the first course ever to make it available to students.</p>
An optional course project is to write a complete compiler for COOL, the Classroom Object Oriented Language. COOL has the essential features of a realistic programming language, but is small and simple enough that it can be implemented in a few thousand lines of code. Students who choose to do the project can implement it in either C++ or Java.<br>I hope you enjoy the course!
<p><strong>Why Study Compilers?</strong></p>
Everything that computers do is the result of some program, and all of the millions of programs in the world are written in one of the many thousands of programming languages that have been developed over the last 60 years. Designing and implementing a programming language turns out to be difficult; some of the best minds in computer science have thought about the problems involved and contributed beautiful and deep results. Learning something about compilers will show you the interplay of theory and practice in computer science, especially how powerful general ideas combined with engineering insight can lead to practical solutions to very hard problems. Knowing how a compiler works will also make you a better programmer and increase your ability to learn new programming languages quickly.

Title:  Modern & Contemporary American Poetry
Short desc:  ModPo is a fast-paced introduction to modern and contemporary U.S. poetry, with an emphasis on experimental verse, from Dickinson and Whitman to the present. Participants (who need no prior experience with poetry) will learn how to read poems that are supposedly "difficult."
Long desc:  In this fast-paced course we will read and encounter and discuss a great range of modern and contemporary U.S. poets working in the "experimental mode," starting with the 19th-century proto-modernists Emily Dickinson and Walt Whitman and ending with 21st-century conceptual poetics. Aside from providing a perhaps handy or helpful survey and chronology of 20th- and 21st-century poetry, this course offers a way of understanding general cultural transitions from modernism to postmodernism. Some people may wish to enroll as much to gain an understanding of the modernism/postmodernism problem through a study of poetry as to gain access to the work of these many poets. Participants do not need to have any prior knowledge of poetry or poetics. The instructor, Al Filreis, rarely lectures, and frequently calls for "the end of the lecture as we know it"; instead, the video-recorded lessons will consist of collaborative close readings led by Filreis, seminar-style -- offering models or samples of readers' interpretations of these knotty but powerful poems, aided by the poetry-minded denizens of the Kelly Writers House on the campus of the University of Pennsylvania.

Title:  Probabilistic Graphical Models
Short desc:  In this class, you will learn the basics of the PGM representation and how to construct them, using both human knowledge and machine learning techniques.
Long desc:  <p><strong>What are Probabilistic Graphical Models?</strong></p>
<p>Uncertainty is unavoidable in real-world applications: we can almost never predict with certainty what will happen in the future, and even in the present and the past, many important aspects of the world are not observed with certainty. Probability theory gives us the basic foundation to model our beliefs about the different possible states of the world, and to update these beliefs as new evidence is obtained. These beliefs can be combined with individual preferences to help guide our actions, and even in selecting which observations to make. While probability theory has existed since the 17th century, our ability to use it effectively on large problems involving many inter-related variables is fairly recent, and is due largely to the development of a framework known as Probabilistic Graphical Models (PGMs). This framework, which spans methods such as Bayesian networks and Markov random fields, uses ideas from discrete data structures in computer science to efficiently encode and manipulate probability distributions over high-dimensional spaces, often involving hundreds or even many thousands of variables. These methods have been used in an enormous range of application domains, which include: web search, medical and fault diagnosis, image understanding, reconstruction of biological networks, speech recognition, natural language processing, decoding of messages sent over a noisy communication channel, robot navigation, and many more. The PGM framework provides an essential tool for anyone who wants to learn how to reason coherently from limited and noisy observations.</p>
In this class, you will learn the basics of the PGM representation and how to construct them, using both human knowledge and machine learning techniques; you will also learn algorithms for using a PGM to reach conclusions about the world from limited and noisy evidence, and for making good decisions under uncertainty. The class covers both the theoretical underpinnings of the PGM framework and practical skills needed to apply these techniques to new problems.

Title:  Algorithms: Design and Analysis, Part 1
Short desc:  In this course you will learn several fundamental principles of algorithm design: divide-and-conquer methods, graph algorithms, practical data structures (heaps, hash tables, search trees), randomized algorithms, and more.
Long desc:  In this course you will learn several fundamental principles of algorithm design. You'll learn the divide-and-conquer design paradigm, with applications to fast sorting, searching, and multiplication. You'll learn several blazingly fast primitives for computing on graphs, such as how to compute connectivity information and shortest paths. Finally, we'll study how allowing the computer to "flip coins" can lead to elegant and practical algorithms and data structures. Learn the answers to questions such as: How do data structures like heaps, hash tables, bloom filters, and balanced search trees actually work, anyway? How come QuickSort runs so fast? What can graph algorithms tell us about the structure of the Web and social networks? Did my 3rd-grade teacher explain only a suboptimal algorithm for multiplying two numbers?

Title:  Game Theory
Short desc:  The course covers the basics: representing games and strategies, the extensive form (which computer scientists call game trees), repeated and stochastic games, coalitional games, and Bayesian games (modeling things like auctions).
Long desc:  Popularized by movies such as "A Beautiful Mind", game theory is the mathematical modeling of strategic interaction among rational (and irrational) agents. Beyond what we call 'games' in common language, such as chess, poker, soccer, etc., it includes the modeling of conflict among nations, political campaigns, competition among firms, and trading behavior in markets such as the NYSE. How could you begin to model eBay, Google keyword auctions, and peer to peer file-sharing networks, without accounting for the incentives of the people using them? The course will provide the basics: representing games and strategies, the extensive form (which computer scientists call game trees), Bayesian games (modeling things like auctions), repeated and stochastic games, and more. We'll include a variety of examples including classic games and real-world applications.

Title:  Cryptography I
Short desc:  Learn about the inner workings of cryptographic primitives and how to apply this knowledge in real-world applications!
Long desc:  <p>Cryptography is an indispensable tool for protecting information in computer systems. This course explains the inner workings of cryptographic primitives and how to correctly use them. Students will learn how to reason about the security of cryptographic constructions and how to apply this knowledge to real-world applications. The course begins with a detailed discussion of how two parties who have a shared secret key can communicate securely when a powerful adversary eavesdrops and tampers with traffic. We will examine many deployed protocols and analyze mistakes in existing systems. The second half of the course discusses public-key techniques that let two or more parties generate a shared secret key. We will cover the relevant number theory and discuss public-key encryption and basic key-exchange.&nbsp;Throughout the course students will be exposed to many exciting open problems in the field.</p>
<p>The course will include written homeworks and programming labs. The course is self-contained, however it will be helpful to have a basic understanding of discrete probability theory.</p>

Title:  Model Thinking
Short desc:  In this class, you will learn how to think with models and use them to make sense of the complex world around us.
Long desc:  We live in a complex world with diverse people, firms, and governments whose behaviors aggregate to produce novel, unexpected phenomena. We see political uprisings, market crashes, and a never ending array of social trends. How do we make sense of it? Models. Evidence shows that people who think with models consistently outperform those who don't. And, moreover people who think with lots of models outperform people who use only one.
Why do models make us better thinkers?
Models help us to better organize information - to make sense of that fire hose or hairball of data (choose your metaphor) available on the Internet. Models improve our abilities to make accurate forecasts. They help us make better decisions and adopt more effective strategies. They even can improve our ability to design institutions and procedures. In this class, I present a starter kit of models: I start with models of tipping points. I move on to cover models explain the wisdom of crowds, models that show why some countries are rich and some are poor, and models that help unpack the strategic decisions of firm and politicians. The models covered in this class provide a foundation for future social science classes, whether they be in economics, political science, business, or sociology. Mastering this material will give you a huge leg up in advanced courses. They also help you in life.
Here's how the course will work.
For each model, I present a short, easily digestible overview lecture. Then, I'll dig deeper. I'll go into the technical details of the model. Those technical lectures won't require calculus but be prepared for some algebra. For all the lectures, I'll offer some questions and we'll have quizzes and even a final exam. If you decide to do the deep dive, and take all the quizzes and the exam, you'll receive a certificate of completion. If you just decide to follow along for the introductory lectures to gain some exposure that's fine too. It's all free. And it's all here to help make you a better thinker!<br><br><b>Subtitles for</b>&nbsp;<b>all video lectures available in</b>:&nbsp;Chinese (provided by&nbsp;<a href="http://coursera.yeeyan.org/" target="_blank">Yeeyan</a>),&nbsp;English,&nbsp;Ukrainian (<a href="http://pinchukfund.org/en/">Pinchuk Foundation</a>)<br>

Title:  Introduction to Sociology
Short desc:  In this class we will cover the essentials of sociology, to help you better understand your own life and situations far from your experience.
Long desc:  We live in a world that is changing very quickly. Sociology gives us the tools to understand our own lives and those quite remote from us. The premise of this class is that in order to benefit from the sociological perspective, we need to learn how to ask certain basic questions. We need to know how to seek answers through methods that strive to be systematic and generalizable.We will begin with some of the essential questions: How are the things that we take to be natural socially constructed? How do we live today? How determined is social life? Does the individual make a difference? How is social order possible? Then we will ask what techniques are available to make sense of these questions.  We will review comparative, historical, demographic, experimental, and ethnographic methods. Along the way, we will study core concepts including ethnocentrism, social networks, community, unanticipated consequences, social capital, race, class, and gender. <br><br> We will strive to understand how interaction in micro-level contexts affects larger social processes and how such macro-level processes influence our day to day lives. We will learn to conceive of inequality by asking how race, class, and gender work in tandem. We will address one of the crises of recent sociology -- whether we can actually isolate the effects of social context. We will think about how social science is changing at a time when we are literally swimming in oceans of data generated by the internet.

Title:  A History of the World since 1300
Short desc:  This course will examine the ways in which the world has grown more integrated yet more divided over the past 700 years.
Long desc:  This course explores the history of the modern world since Chinggis Khan. It focuses on the connections between societies from the time of the Mongol conquests and the gradual, but accelerating ways in which connections became ties of inter-dependence. The relations between societies are what will concern us. The forces pulling the world together vary from religious to economic, political to intellectual. These forces bring the world together, but they also create new divisions. Nowadays, we call this "globalization." That term has tended to emphasize the drive to worldwide integration; the view of globalization taken in this course emphasizes disintegration as well as integration. We will tackle some very basic questions: How do we explain the staggering wealth of China in the centuries up to 1750, as well as China's recent ascent? Where did the United States come from, and where is it headed? What are the significance and legacies of empire in the world? How have world wars and revolutions shaped the international system over time? What exactly is globalization, and how does today's globalization compare with the past? How has the relationship between humans and nature changed over the centuries?

Title:  Computer Architecture
Short desc:  In this course, you will learn to design the computer architecture of complex modern microprocessors.
Long desc:  This course forms a strong foundation in the understanding and design of modern computing systems. Building on a computer organization base, this course explores techniques that go into designing a modern microprocessor. Fundamental understanding of computer architecture is key not only for students interested in hardware and processor design, but is a foundation for students interested in compilers, operating systems, and high performance programming. This course will explore how the computer architect can utilize the increasing number of transistors available to improve the performance of a processor. Focus will be given to architectures that can exploit different forms of parallelism, whether they be implicit or explicit. This course covers architectural techniques such as multi-issue superscalar processors, out-of-order processors, Very Long Instruction Word (VLIW) processors, advanced caching, and multiprocessor systems.

Title:  Statistics One
Short desc:  Statistics One is a comprehensive yet friendly introduction to statistics.
Long desc:  <p>Statistics One is designed to be a comprehensive yet friendly introduction
    to fundamental concepts in statistics. Comprehensive means that this course
    provides a solid foundation for students planning to pursue more advanced
    courses in statistics. Friendly means exactly that. The course assumes
    very little background knowledge in statistics and introduces new concepts
    with several fun and easy to understand examples. </p>
<p>This course is, quite literally, for everyone. If you think you can't
    learn statistics, this course is for you. If you had a statistics course
    before but feel like you need a refresher, this course is for you. Even
    if you are a relatively advanced researcher or analyst, this course provides
    a foundation and a context that helps to put one’s work into perspective.</p>
<p>Statistics One also provides an introduction to the R programming language.
    All the examples and assignments will involve writing code in R and interpreting
    R output. R software is free! What this means is you can download R, take
    this course, and start programming in R after just a few lectures. That
    said, this course is not a comprehensive guide to R or to programming in
    general. </p>

Title:  Social Network Analysis
Short desc:  This course will use social network analysis, both its theory and computational tools, to make sense of the social and information networks that have been fueled and rendered accessible by the internet.
Long desc:  Everything is connected: people, information, events and places, all the more so with the advent of online social media. A practical way of making sense of the tangle of connections is to analyze them as networks. In this course you will learn about the structure and evolution of networks, drawing on knowledge from disciplines as diverse as sociology, mathematics, computer science, economics, and physics. Online interactive demonstrations and hands-on analysis of real-world data sets will focus on a range of tasks: from identifying important nodes in the network, to detecting communities, to tracing information diffusion and opinion formation.

Title:  Securing Digital Democracy
Short desc:  In this course, you'll learn what every citizen should know about the security risks--and future potential — of electronic voting and Internet voting.
Long desc:  Computer technology has transformed how we participate in democracy. The way we cast our votes, the way our votes are counted, and the way we choose who will lead are increasingly controlled by invisible computer software. Most U.S. states have adopted electronic voting, and countries around the world are starting to collect votes over the Internet. However, computerized voting raises startling security risks that are only beginning to be understood outside the research lab, from voting machine viruses that can silently change votes to the possibility that hackers in foreign countries could steal an election. This course will provide the technical background and public policy foundation that 21st century citizens need to understand the electronic voting debate. You'll learn how electronic voting and Internet voting technologies work, why they're being introduced, and what problems they aim to solve. You'll also learn about the computer- and Internet-security risks these systems face and the serious vulnerabilities that recent research has demonstrated. We'll cover widely used safeguards, checks, and balances — and why they are often inadequate. Finally, we'll see how computer technology has the potential to improve election security, if it's applied intelligently. Along the way, you'll hear stories from the lab and from the trenches on a journey that leads from Mumbai jail cells to the halls of Washington, D.C. You'll come away from this course understanding why you can be confident your own vote will count — or why you should reasonably be skeptical.

Title:  Fantasy and Science Fiction: The Human Mind, Our Modern World
Short desc:  We understand the world — and our selves — through stories. Then some of those hopes and fears become the world.
Long desc:  Fantasy is a key term both in psychology and in the art and artifice of
humanity. The things we make, including our stories, reflect, serve, and
often shape our needs and desires. We see this everywhere from fairy tale
to kiddie lit to myth; from "Cinderella" to <i>Alice in Wonderland </i>to <i>Superman</i>;
from building a fort as a child to building ideal, planned cities as whole
societies. Fantasy in ways both entertaining and practical serves our persistent
needs and desires and illuminates the human mind. Fantasy expresses itself
in many ways, from the comfort we feel in the godlike powers of a fairy
godmother to the seductive unease we feel confronting Dracula. From a practical
viewpoint, of all the fictional forms that fantasy takes, science fiction,
from <i>Frankenstein</i> to <i>Avatar</i>, is the most important in our modern
world because it is the only kind that explicitly recognizes the profound
ways in which science and technology, those key products of the human mind,
shape not only our world but our very hopes and fears. This course will
explore Fantasy in general and Science Fiction in specific both as art
and as insights into ourselves and our world.

Title:  Listening to World Music
Short desc:  Learn the ideas and vocabulary for listening to world music, and examine the music of several world music cultures and how they have entered into mainstream popular culture.
Long desc:  With the click of a mouse, now more than ever we are able to access sounds made by people from all around the world. And yet, most of us don't listen to the wide diversity of music available to us, probably because it sounds so strange. This class will open up the world of music to you. We begin with a brief history of recording technology, the music industry and the place of world music in that narrative; you are introduced to keywords for talking about music cross-culturally; and then proceed to half a dozen musical cultures around the world. In each of these musical cultures, we examine the ways in which music works in those distant cultures, how it sounds, what it means, who may perform it; and then we ask ourselves where this music has traveled and entered into the Western popular culture as entertainment, political discourse, or artistic purpose.

Title:  Greek and Roman Mythology
Short desc:  This course will focus on the myths of ancient Greece and Rome, as a way of exploring the nature of myth and the function it plays for individuals, societies, and nations.
Long desc:  Myths are traditional stories that have endured over a long time. Some
of them have to do with events of great importance, such as the founding
of a nation. Others tell the stories of great heroes and heroines and their
exploits and courage in the face of adversity. Still others are simple
tales about otherwise unremarkable people who get into trouble or do some
great deed. What are we to make of all these tales, and why do people seem
to like to hear them? This course will focus on the myths of ancient Greece
and Rome, as a way of exploring the nature of myth and the function it
plays for individuals, societies, and nations. We will also pay some attention
to the way the Greeks and Romans themselves understood their own myths.
Are myths subtle codes that contain some universal truth? Are they a window
on the deep recesses of a particular culture? Are they a set of blinders
that all of us wear, though we do not realize it? Or are they just entertaining
stories that people like to tell over and over? This course will investigate
these questions through a variety of topics, including the creation of
the universe, the relationship between gods and mortals, human nature,
religion, the family, sex, love, madness, and death.

Title:  Gamification
Short desc:  Gamification is the application of game elements and digital game design techniques to non-game problems, such as business and social impact challenges. This course will teach you the mechanisms of gamification, why it has such tremendous potential, and how to use it effectively.
Long desc:  <div>Gamification is the application of digital game design techniques to non-game problems, such as business and social impact challenges. Video games are the dominant entertainment form of our time because they are powerful tools for motivating behavior.
    Effective games leverage both psychology and technology, in ways that can be applied outside the immersive environments of games themselves. Gamification as a business practice has exploded over the past two years. Organizations are applying it in
    areas such as marketing, human resources, productivity enhancement, sustainability, training, health and wellness, innovation, and customer engagement. Game thinking means more than just dropping in badges and leaderboards; it requires a thoughtful
    understanding of motivation and design techniques. This course examines the mechanisms of gamification and provides an understanding of its effective use.

Title:  Fundamentals of Pharmacology
Short desc:  In this class you will learn how drugs affect the body, how they alter disease processes and how they might produce toxicity. We will discuss how new drugs are tested and developed prior to them being used for patient care. We will describe how personalization of medicine will become a common day reality in patient care.
Long desc:  This set of courses will discuss the discipline of pharmacology and its integration throughout medical science. Specifically, the content will be organized as follows: 1) Basic Pharmacological Principles; 2) Applied Pharmacology, the concept of applying the basic principles to each organ system with an emphasis on melding pathophysiology with biologic targets for drug therapy; 3) Therapeutics, considered to be the clinical application of applied pharmacology, including the financial implications of therapy, evidence-based medicine, and the limitations of drug therapy and future directions of therapeutics in all disease states, as well as the legal implications of prescription writing; and 4) Advanced Pharmacological Principles, such as cancer therapeutics.

Long desc:  <p>Each of our cells contains nearly identical copies of our genome, which provides instructions that allow us to develop and function. The field of Genomics focuses on the structure and function of genomes and plays a major and increasing role in both medicine and research. This course serves as an introduction to the main laboratory and theoretical aspects of genomics and is divided into themes: genomes, genetics, functional genomics, systems biology, single cell approaches, proteomics, and applications. We start with the basics, DNA sequencing and the genome project, then move to high throughput sequencing methods and applications. Next we introduce principles of genetics and then apply them in clinical genetics and other large-scale sequencing projects. In the functional genomics unit, we start with RNA expression dynamics, analysis of alternative splicing, epigenomics and ChIP-seq, and metagenomics. Model organisms and forward and reverse genetics screens are then discussed, along with quantitative trait locus (QTL) and eQTL analysis. After that, we introduce integrative and single cell genomics approaches and systems biology. Finally, we conclude by introducing in applying proteomic approaches.</p><div><br></div>

Title:  Networks: Friends, Money, and Bytes
Short desc:  A course driven by 20 practical questions about wireless, web, and the Internet, about how products from companies like Apple, Google, Facebook, Netflix, Amazon, Ericsson, HP, Skype and AT&T work.

In this offering, we will cover 7 of the 20 questions, and you will have the opportunity to personalize your own learning experience by choosing which of the versions suits you best.
Long desc:  You pick up your iPhone while waiting in line at a coffee shop. You google a not-so-famous actor, get linked to a Wikipedia entry listing his recent movies and popular YouTube clips of several of them. You check out user reviews on Amazon and pick one,
download that movie on BitTorrent or stream that in Netflix. But suddenly the WiFi logo on your phone is gone and you're on 3G. Video quality starts to degrade, but you don't know if it's the server getting crowded or the Internet is congested somewhere.
In any case, it costs you $10 per Gigabyte, and you decide to stop watching the movie, and instead multitask between sending tweets and calling your friend on Skype, while songs stream from iCloud to your phone. You're happy with the call quality, but
get a little irritated when you see there're no new followers on Twitter. You may wonder how they all kind of work, and why sometimes they don't. Take a look at the list of 20 questions below. Each question is selected not just for its relevance to our
daily lives, but also for the core concepts in the field of networking illustrated by its answers. This course is about formulating and answering some of these 20 questions.

Title:  Compilers
Short desc:  This course will discuss the major ideas used today in the implementation of programming language compilers. You will learn how a program written in a high-level language designed for humans is systematically translated into a program written in low-level assembly more suited to machines!
Long desc:  <p>This course will discuss the major ideas used today in the implementation of programming language compilers, including lexical analysis, parsing, syntax-directed translation, abstract syntax trees, types and type checking, intermediate languages, dataflow analysis, program optimization, code generation, and runtime systems. As a result, you will learn how a program written in a high-level language designed for humans is systematically translated into a program written in low-level assembly more suited to machines. Along the way we will also touch on how programming languages are designed, programming language semantics, and why there are so many different kinds of programming languages.</p>
<p>The course lectures will be presented in short videos. To help you master the material, there will be in-lecture questions to answer, quizzes, and two exams: a midterm and a final. There will also be homework in the form of exercises that ask you to show a sequence of logical steps needed to derive a specific result, such as the sequence of steps a type checker would perform to type check a piece of code, or the sequence of steps a parser would perform to parse an input string. This checking technology is the result of ongoing research at Stanford into developing innovative tools for education, and we're excited to be the first course ever to make it available to students.</p>
An optional course project is to write a complete compiler for COOL, the Classroom Object Oriented Language. COOL has the essential features of a realistic programming language, but is small and simple enough that it can be implemented in a few thousand lines of code. Students who choose to do the project can implement it in either C++ or Java.<br>I hope you enjoy the course!
<p><strong>Why Study Compilers?</strong></p>
Everything that computers do is the result of some program, and all of the millions of programs in the world are written in one of the many thousands of programming languages that have been developed over the last 60 years. Designing and implementing a programming language turns out to be difficult; some of the best minds in computer science have thought about the problems involved and contributed beautiful and deep results. Learning something about compilers will show you the interplay of theory and practice in computer science, especially how powerful general ideas combined with engineering insight can lead to practical solutions to very hard problems. Knowing how a compiler works will also make you a better programmer and increase your ability to learn new programming languages quickly.

Title:  Machine Learning
Short desc:  Learn about the most effective machine learning techniques, and gain practice implementing them and getting them to work for yourself.
Long desc:  <p>Machine learning is the science of getting computers to act without being
    explicitly programmed. In the past decade, machine learning has given us
    self-driving cars, practical speech recognition, effective web search,
    and a vastly improved understanding of the human genome. Machine learning
    is so pervasive today that you probably use it dozens of times a day without
    knowing it. Many researchers also think it is the best way to make progress
    towards human-level AI. In this class, you will learn about the most effective
    machine learning techniques, and gain practice implementing them and getting
    them to work for yourself. More importantly, you'll learn about not only
    the theoretical underpinnings of learning, but also gain the practical
    know-how needed to quickly and powerfully apply these techniques to new
    problems. Finally, you'll learn about some of Silicon Valley's best practices
    in innovation as it pertains to machine learning and AI.</p>
<p>This course provides a broad introduction to machine learning, datamining,
    and statistical pattern recognition. Topics include: (i) Supervised learning
    (parametric/non-parametric algorithms, support vector machines, kernels,
    neural networks). (ii) Unsupervised learning (clustering, dimensionality
    reduction, recommender systems, deep learning). (iii) Best practices in
    machine learning (bias/variance theory; innovation process in machine learning
    and AI). The course will also draw from numerous case studies and applications,
    so that you'll also learn how to apply learning algorithms to building
    smart robots (perception, control), text understanding (web search, anti-spam),
    computer vision, medical informatics, audio, database mining, and other
    areas.</p>

Title:  Computer Science 101
Short desc:  CS101 teaches the essential ideas of Computer Science for a zero-prior-experience audience. The course uses small coding experiments in the browser to play with the nature of computers, understanding their strengths and limitations. Sign up for the "To be announced" session to be notified by email when the class is next run, and sign up for "Self-Study" to start browsing the class materials right away. Self-Study mode makes all the videos and assignments available to be done at your own pace, but without a certificate of completion at the end.
Long desc:  <p>CS101 teaches the essential ideas of Computer Science for a zero-prior-experience audience. Computers can appear very complicated, but in reality, computers work within just a few, simple patterns. CS101 demystifies and brings those patterns to life, which is useful for anyone using computers today.</p>
<p>In CS101, students play and experiment with short bits of "computer code" to bring to life to the power and limitations of computers. Everything works within the browser, so there is no extra software to download or install. CS101 also provides a general background on computers today: what is a computer, what is hardware, what is software, what is the internet. No previous experience is required other than the ability to use a web browser.</p>

Title:  Automata
Short desc:  This course covers finite automata, context-free grammars, Turing machines, undecidable problems, and intractable problems (NP-completeness).
Long desc:  <p>I am pleased to be able to offer free over the Internet a course on Automata Theory, based on the material I have taught periodically at Stanford in the course CS154. Students have access to screencast lecture videos, are given quiz questions, assignments and exams, receive regular feedback on progress, and can participate in a discussion forum. Those who successfully complete the course will receive a statement of accomplishment. You will need a decent Internet connection for accessing course materials, but should be able to watch the videos on your smartphone.</p>
The course covers four broad areas: (1) Finite automata and regular expressions, (2) Context-free grammars, (3) Turing machines and decidability, and (4) the theory of intractability, or NP-complete problems.<br><strong><br>Why Study Automata Theory?</strong><br><br>This subject is not just for those planning to enter the field of complexity theory, although it is a good place to start if that is your goal. Rather, the course will emphasize those aspects of the theory that people really use in practice. Finite automata, regular expressions, and context-free grammars are ideas that have stood the test of time. They are essential tools for compilers. But more importantly, they are used in many systems that require input that is less general than a full programming language yet more complex than "push this button."<br><br>The concepts of undecidable problems and intractable problems serve a different purpose. Undecidable problems are those for which no computer solution can ever exist, while intractable problems are those for which there is strong evidence that, although they can be solved by a computer, they cannot be solved sufficiently fast that the solution is truly useful in practice. Understanding this theory, and in particular being able to prove that a problem you are facing belongs to one of these classes, allows you to justify taking another approach — simplifying the problem or writing code to approximate the solution, for example.<br><br>During the course, I'm going to prove a number of things. The purpose of these proofs is not to torture you or confuse you. Neither are the proofs there because I doubt you would believe me were I merely to state some well-known fact. Rather, understanding how these proofs, especially inductive proofs, work, lets you think more clearly about your own work. I do not advocate proofs that programs are correct, but whenever you attempt something a bit complex, it is good to have in mind the inductive proofs that would be needed to guarantee that what you are doing really works in all cases.

Title:  Introduction to Logic
Short desc:  In this course, you will learn how to formalize information and reason systematically to produce logical conclusions. We will also examine logic technology and its applications - in mathematics, science, engineering, business, law, and so forth.
Long desc:  <p>Logic is one of the oldest intellectual disciplines in human history.
    It dates back to the times of Aristotle; it has been studied through the
    centuries; and it is still a subject of active investigation today.</p>
<p>This course is a basic introduction to Logic. It shows how to formalize
    information in form of logical sentences. It shows how to reason systematically
    with this information to produce all logical conclusions and only logical
    conclusions. And it examines logic technology and its applications - in
    mathematics, science, engineering, business, law, and so forth.</p>
<p>The course differs from other introductory courses in Logic in two important
    ways. First of all, it teaches a novel theory of logic that improves accessibility
    while preserving rigor. Second, the material is laced with interactive
    demonstrations and exercises that suggest the many practical applications
    of the field.</p>

Title:  Cryptography I
Short desc:  Learn about the inner workings of cryptographic primitives and how to apply this knowledge in real-world applications!
Long desc:  <p>Cryptography is an indispensable tool for protecting information in computer systems. This course explains the inner workings of cryptographic primitives and how to correctly use them. Students will learn how to reason about the security of cryptographic constructions and how to apply this knowledge to real-world applications. The course begins with a detailed discussion of how two parties who have a shared secret key can communicate securely when a powerful adversary eavesdrops and tampers with traffic. We will examine many deployed protocols and analyze mistakes in existing systems. The second half of the course discusses public-key techniques that let two or more parties generate a shared secret key. We will cover the relevant number theory and discuss public-key encryption and basic key-exchange.&nbsp;Throughout the course students will be exposed to many exciting open problems in the field.</p>
<p>The course will include written homeworks and programming labs. The course is self-contained, however it will be helpful to have a basic understanding of discrete probability theory.</p>

Short desc:  In this course you will learn several fundamental principles of algorithm design: divide-and-conquer methods, graph algorithms, practical data structures (heaps, hash tables, search trees), randomized algorithms, and more.
Long desc:  In this course you will learn several fundamental principles of algorithm design. You'll learn the divide-and-conquer design paradigm, with applications to fast sorting, searching, and multiplication. You'll learn several blazingly fast primitives for computing on graphs, such as how to compute connectivity information and shortest paths. Finally, we'll study how allowing the computer to "flip coins" can lead to elegant and practical algorithms and data structures. Learn the answers to questions such as: How do data structures like heaps, hash tables, bloom filters, and balanced search trees actually work, anyway? How come QuickSort runs so fast? What can graph algorithms tell us about the structure of the Web and social networks? Did my 3rd-grade teacher explain only a suboptimal algorithm for multiplying two numbers?

Title:  Introduction to Mathematical Thinking
Short desc:  Learn how to think the way mathematicians do - a powerful cognitive process developed over thousands of years.
Long desc:  <div><b><i>NOTE: For the Winter 2014 session, the course website will go live at 10:00 AM US-PST on Saturday February 1, two days before the course begins, so you have time to familiarize yourself with the website structure, watch some short introductory videos, and look at some preliminary material.<br><br></i></b>The goal of the course is to help you develop a valuable mental ability – a powerful way of thinking that our ancestors have developed over three thousand years.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Mathematical thinking is not the same as doing mathematics – at least not as mathematics is typically presented in our school system. School math typically focuses on learning procedures to solve highly stereotyped problems. Professional mathematicians think a certain way to solve real problems, problems that can arise from the everyday world, or from science, or from within mathematics itself. The key to success in school math is to learn to think inside-the-box. In contrast, a key feature of mathematical thinking is thinking outside-the-box – a valuable ability in today’s world. This course helps to develop that crucial way of thinking.</div>
<div> <br>The course is offered in two versions. The eight-week-long Basic Course is designed for people who want to develop or improve mathematics-based, analytic thinking for professional or general life purposes. The ten-week-long Extended Course is aimed primarily at first-year students at college or university who are thinking of majoring in mathematics or a mathematically-dependent subject, or high school seniors who have such a college career in mind. The final two weeks are more intensive and require more mathematical background than the Basic Course. There is no need to make a formal election between the two. Simply skip or drop out of the final two weeks if you decide you want to complete only the Basic Course.</div><div><br><b>Subtitles for all video lectures available in</b>: Portuguese (provided by <a href="http://www.fundacaolemann.org.br/" target="_blank">The Lemann Foundation</a>), English<br></div>

Title:  Neuroethics
Short desc:  This course will examine the ethical, legal and social issues raised by neuroscience. Topics will include the implications of new knowledge of the brain for our understanding of selfhood, for the meaning of privacy, for the distinction between therapy and enhancement, and for national security.
Long desc:  “Perhaps a man really dies when his brain stops, when he loses the power to take in a new idea.” --George Orwell<br><br> Neuroethics might well be the most rapidly growing area within bioethics; indeed, in some respects neuroethics has grown as an independent field, with its own journals, professional society and institutional centers. This growth over the past decade is partly attributable to the growth of neuroscience itself and to the challenging philosophical and moral questions it inherently raises. A 2012 Royal Society report observes that “(a)n increasingly mechanistic understanding of the brain raises a host of ethical, legal, and social implications. This has laid the foundation for the emergent field of Neuroethics, which examines ethical issues governing the conceptual and practical developments of neuroscience. Irrespective of their validity, even the claims that modern neuroscience entails the re-examination of complex and sensitive topics like free will, consciousness, identity, and responsibility raises significant ethical issues. As such, neuroethics asks questions that extend beyond the usual umbrella of biomedical ethics.” This course will, therefore, consider the new knowledge and ways of learning about the brain from scientific and ethico-legal and social standpoints. We will examine the core themes of neuroethics, including cognitive enhancement, the nature of the self and personhood, neuroimaging and privacy, and the ways that all these themes are brought together in matters affecting national security.<br><br> <strong><br></strong>

Title:  Rationing and Allocating Scarce Medical Resources
Short desc:  This course will explore the complex challenges of allocating scarce medical resources at both the micro and macro level. Students will learn the theories behind allocation and use modern examples to explore how society makes the difficult decisions that arise when there is not enough to go around.
Long desc:  <p>You have one liver but three patients awaiting a liver transplant. 
Who should get the liver? What criteria should be used to select the 
recipient? Is it fair to give it to an alcoholic? These are some of the 
questions that arise in the context of rationing and allocating scarce 
health care resources among particular individuals, and concern what are
 called micro-allocation decisions. But trade-offs also need to be made 
at the meso- and macro-level. Budgets of public payers of healthcare, 
such as governments, and of private ones, such as health plans, are 
limited: they cannot cover all drugs and services that appear beneficial
 to patients or physicians. So what services should they provide? Is 
there a core set of benefits that everyone should be entitled to? How 
can we make fair decisions, if we know from the outset than not all 
needs can be met? Using the cases of organs for transplantation, the 
rationing for vaccines in a flu pandemic, and drug shortages, the course
 will critically examine alternative theories for allocating scarce 
resources among individuals, while also exploring the principles and 
values that underlie those theories.</p>

Title:  An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python
Short desc:  This course is designed to be a fun introduction to the basics of programming in Python. Our main focus will be on building simple interactive games such as Pong, Blackjack and Asteroids.
Long desc:  <div>This course is designed to help students with very little or no computing
    background learn the basics of building simple interactive applications.
    &nbsp;Our language of choice, Python, is an easy-to learn, high-level computer
    language that is used in many of the computational courses offered on Coursera.
    To make learning Python easy, we have developed a new browser-based programming
    environment that makes developing interactive applications in Python simple.
    &nbsp;These applications will involve windows whose contents are graphical
    and respond to buttons, the keyboard and the mouse.
    <br>
    <br>The primary method for learning the course material will be to work through
    multiple "mini-projects" in Python. &nbsp;To make this class enjoyable,
    these projects will include building fun games such as Pong, Blackjack,
    and Asteroids. &nbsp;When you’ve finished our course, we can’t promise
    that you will be a professional programmer, but we think that you will
    learn a lot about programming in Python and have fun while you’re doing
    it.</div>

Title:  Bioelectricity: A Quantitative Approach
Short desc:  Nerves, the heart, and the brain are electrical. How do these things work? This course presents fundamental principles, described quantitatively.
Long desc:  <p>In this class you will learn how to think about electrically active
tissue in terms of individual mechanisms, and you will learn to analyze the
mechanisms quantitatively as well as describe them qualitatively. &nbsp;The
course uses many of the same examples used by Hodgkin and Huxley, who won the
Nobel Prize for their experimental unraveling of the mechanisms of the nerve
axon of the giant squid, and their creation of a mathematical model of
membranes and propagation to understand its function. &nbsp;That work has been
the foundational element of most subsequent understandings of electrically
active tissue, whether in nerves, the brain or in muscle, including the heart. 
</p>
<p>
In this course, topics include:
</p><ol>
<li>The electrical charging of active membranes from the creation and use of differences in ionic concentrations across the membrane.</li>
<li>The stimulation of the membrane, both naturally and from engineered sources.</li>
<li>The creation of action potentials by the membrane in response to stimulation.</li>
<li>The chain reaction of membrane responses, with each small region or cell initiating an action potential in adjacent ones.</li>
<li>The observation of associated electrical currents in terms of extracellular wave voltages they create, the basis of clinical measurements such as the electrocardiogram.</li>
</ol>
<p></p>
<p>
The course will at each step present equations and other quantitative reasoning so that you will be able to go beyond describing what happens qualitatively and be able to link together the phenomena in the mosaic in a quantitative fashion, which is essential to judging whether specific changes in inputs are important to the outcome. Through the use of quantitative analysis, you will learn that all the elements of the system are tied together and be able to link together and analyze the effects of one part on another.

Title:  Introduction to Genetics and Evolution
Short desc:  A whirlwind introduction to evolution and genetics, from basic principles to current applications, including how disease genes are mapped and how we leverage evolutionary concepts to aid humanity.
Long desc:  Introduction to Genetics and Evolution is a college-level class being offered simultaneously to new students at <a target="_blank" href="http://biology.duke.edu/">Duke University</a>. The course gives interested people a very basic overview of some principles behind these very fundamental areas of biology.  We often hear about new "genome sequences," commercial kits that can tell you about your ancestry (including pre-human) from your DNA or disease predispositions, debates about the truth of evolution, why animals behave the way they do, and how people found "genetic evidence for natural selection."  This course provides the basic biology you need to understand all of these issues better, tries to clarify some misconceptions, and tries to prepare students for future, more advanced coursework in Biology.  No prior coursework is assumed.<br><br>

Short desc:  An introduction to astronomy through a broad survey of what we know about the universe and how we know it.
Long desc:  In this class, we will be studying, quite literally, everything in the universe. &nbsp;We will start with "classical" astronomy, describing the night sky and organizing what we see as was done in ancient times. &nbsp;We will then embark on a journey,
starting here on Earth and progressing outward, to study the Solar system, the Milky Way galaxy, and the wonderful and strange objects we observe in deep space, such as black holes, quasars, and supernovae. &nbsp;We will end with some discussion of what
scientists know today about the universe as a whole. &nbsp;Along the way we will introduce some of the methods, theoretical and experimental, that have been used to understand all of this, from Newton's laws, through our understanding of light and matter,
to Einstein's theory of relativity, and from Galileo's telescope to WMAP.

Title:  Clinical Problem Solving
Short desc:  Participants will learn how to move efficiently from patient signs and symptoms to a rational and prioritized set of diagnostic possibilities and will learn how to study and read to facilitate this process.
Long desc:  <div>Clinical problem solving or diagnostic reasoning is the skill that physicians use to understand a patient’s complaints and then to identify a short, prioritized list of possible diagnoses that could account for those complaints. &nbsp;This differential diagnosis then drives the choice of diagnostic tests and possible treatments. Despite striking advances in information technology, clinical problem solving has not yet been effectively replicated by computers, making it essential that clinicians work to develop expertise in this very important skill set. &nbsp;While television shows make this seem like a magical process, work done by cognitive psychologists and medical educators has helped us understand the ways in which expert physicians reason through these difficult problems to help their patients.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>This course will examine the ways physicians think about clinical problem solving and will help participants develop competence in the building blocks of clinical problem solving. The professor will use cases to illustrate different reasoning strategies and will discuss how both correct and incorrect diagnoses result from these strategies. Participants will use sample clinical cases to practice what they have learned through the lectures. Finally, the professor will discuss strategies to help students and young physicians read textbooks and articles in a way that enhances their ability to use information in the clinical environment.&nbsp;</div>

Title:  Principles of Obesity Economics
Short desc:  The resources available to individuals and society and the prices of goods in the market shape our choices - even about the food we eat and the weight at which we live. This course explores the economic motivation for consumer choice and the economic role of government in markets related to obesity.
Long desc:  Economics motivates consumer behavior based on preferences, relative prices,
and time and money constraints. &nbsp;Economics motivates the role for
government based on market failure. &nbsp;Obesity has been deemed a critical
public health problem. &nbsp;This course explores how consumer choices

Title:  An Introduction to the U.S. Food System: Perspectives from Public Health
Short desc:  Explore how food intersects with public health and the environment as it moves from field to plate.
Long desc:  A food system encompasses the activities, people and resources involved
in getting food from field to plate. Along the way, it intersects with
aspects of public health, equity and the environment.  In this course,
we will provide a brief introduction to the U.S. food system and how food
production practices and what we choose to eat impacts the world in which
we live. Through several case studies, we will discuss some key historical
and political factors that have helped shape the current food system and
consider alternative approaches from farm to fork. The course will be led
by a team of faculty and staff from the Johns Hopkins Center for a Livable
Future.  Guest lecturers will include experts from a variety of disciplines,
including public health and agriculture.

Title:  Vaccine Trials: Methods and Best Practices
Short desc:  This course will explore the process of evaluating investigational vaccines in clinical trials including informed consent, recruitment, enrollment, safety evaluation, and quality data collection.
Long desc:  <div>Vaccines are evaluated through a series of clearly defined controlled
    studies to assess these investigational products for safety, immunogenicity
    and efficacy before they are approved for licensure. &nbsp;All clinical
    vaccine trials are bound by international ethical guidelines and, in the
    case of US trials, Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulations.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Good Clinical Practice is defined by the International Conferences on
    Harmonization (ICH) as: “A standard for the design, conduct, performance,
    monitoring, auditing, recording, analysis, and reporting of clinical trials
    that provides assurance that the data and reported results are credible
    and accurate, and that the rights, integrity and confidentiality of trial
    subjects are protected.”</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>That’s a tall order, so how is it done? &nbsp;Individuals who enroll as
    subjects in these trials play an essential role in the development and
    evaluation of new and improved candidate vaccines. &nbsp;They are average
    citizens who volunteer to roll up their sleeves and, in the process, make
    a tremendous difference in society. &nbsp;So why do they volunteer and
    what safeguards do we put in place to protect their rights, safety and
    well-being while in the trial? &nbsp;What are the responsibilities of the
    investigators, sponsors and ethics committees who conduct and oversee these
    trials?&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Along with our colleagues, we will introduce you to how GCP is applied
    in clinical vaccine trials to ensure proper and ethical scientific conduct.
    The course will use examples from real vaccine trials to demonstrate the
    application of the FDA Code of Federal Regulations and ICH GCP Guidelines
    to explore methods and best practices involved in implementing phase I
    and II vaccine clinical trials. &nbsp;This short course offering through
    Coursera is based on our work at the Center for Immunization Research and
    an in-depth graduate course taught at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School
    of Public Health.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>We hope it inspires you to work in this exciting field.</div>

Title:  Learn to Program: The Fundamentals
Short desc:  Behind every mouse click and touch-screen tap, there is a computer program that makes things happen. This course introduces the fundamental building blocks of programming and teaches you how to write fun and useful programs using the Python language.
Long desc:  A computer program is a set of instructions for a computer to follow, just as a recipe is a set of instructions for a chef. Laptops, kitchen appliances, MP3 players, and many other electronic devices all run computer programs. Programs have been written to manipulate sound and video, write poetry, run banking systems, predict the weather, and analyze athletic performance. This course is intended for people who have never seen a computer program. It will give you a better understanding of how computer applications work and teach you how to write your own applications. More importantly, you’ll start to learn computational thinking, which is a fundamental approach to solving real-world problems. Computer programming languages share common fundamental concepts, and this course will introduce you to those concepts using the Python programming language. By the end of this course, you will be able to write your own programs to process data from the web and create interactive text-based games.

Title:  Learn to Program: Crafting Quality Code
Short desc:  Not all programs are created equal.  In this course, we'll focus on writing quality code that runs correctly and efficiently.  We'll design, code and validate our programs and learn how to compare programs that are addressing the same task.
Long desc:  <div>Most programs are used for years and are worked on by many people. Having programs that are easy to understand is essential, in the same way that a well-organized essay is far easier to follow than a disorganized one. We’ll show you an approach that helps to break down problems into smaller tasks that are easier to both solve and read.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>This design approach also makes it more straightforward to find and fix flaws. You'll be introduced to the tools that professional programmers use; they're called "testing" and "debugging".</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>For most complex problems, there are many programs that solve them. Some are inherently slower than others. You'll learn how to read two programs and compare them for efficiency.</div>

Title:  Neural Networks for Machine Learning
Short desc:  Learn about artificial neural networks and how they're being used for machine learning, as applied to speech and object recognition, image segmentation, modeling language and human motion, etc. We'll emphasize both the basic algorithms and the practical tricks needed to get them to work well.
Long desc:  Neural networks use learning algorithms that are inspired by our understanding of how the brain learns, but they are evaluated by how well they work for practical applications such as speech recognition, object recognition, image retrieval and the ability to recommend products that a user will like. As computers become more powerful, Neural Networks are gradually taking over from simpler Machine Learning methods. They are already at the heart of a new generation of speech recognition devices and they are beginning to outperform earlier systems for recognizing objects in images. The course will explain the new learning procedures that are responsible for these advances, including effective new proceduresr for learning multiple layers of non-linear features, and give you the skills and understanding required to apply these procedures in many other domains. <br><br> <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyzOUbkUf3M">This YouTube video</a> gives examples of the kind of material that will be in the course, but the course will present this material at a much gentler rate and with more examples.

Title:  The Social Context of Mental Health and Illness
Short desc:  Learn how social factors promote mental health, influence the onset and course of mental illness, and affect how mental illnesses are diagnosed and treated.
Long desc:  Mental health and mental illness used to be something that people didn’t
talk about, but now it seems every time we open a newspaper we are hearing
about the importance of mental health, or the consequences of mental illness.
At this point in our history we understand mental illness and mental health
to be largely influenced by biological factors, specifically, workings
of the brain. At the same time, we have always known that social factors
play a very strong role in promoting mental health and can make big differences
in who gets mentally ill, who gets treated for mental illness, and how
people can achieve good quality of life after a mental health diagnosis.
<br>
<br>This course is an opportunity to explore how social practices and ideas
contribute to the ways in which society, families and individuals are affected
by mental health and mental illness. We will look at issues like why some
people think mental illness is a myth, how people think about mental health
and illness in different cultures, who gets mentally ill and why, how families
are affected by mental illness and what interventions are available to
treat mental illness and promote mental health.

Title:  Energy 101
Short desc:  As a society and individually, we use energy every moment of our lives to improve our quality of life. Energy 101 will develop the big picture and connect the details of our energy use, technology, infrastructure, impact, and future.
Long desc:  Energy 101 focuses on the big energy picture giving perspective and context to the details one reads in the daily onslaught of energy news in the headlines. As the number 101 indicates, there are no pre-requisites and no particular training or background needed. The course will review the driving forces of energy used in transportation, building heating and cooling, electrical loads and manufacturing. The current facts and trends of the resulting demands placed on coal, oil, natural gas, nuclear, biomass, solar and wind used to meet these energy demands are then covered. The technologies and characteristics of different energy processes and infrastructure used to convert the renewable, fossil, and nuclear energy into the desired form necessary to accomplish a given task are then described. Economics is always a part of the discussion. The natural laws of thermodynamics limiting these processes are described, as well as future technologies and their potential.

Title:  Control of Mobile Robots
Short desc:  Learn about how to make mobile robots move in effective, safe, predictable, and collaborative ways using modern control theory.
Long desc:  This course investigates how to make mobile robots move in effective, safe, and predictable ways. The basic tool for achieving this is "control theory", which deals with the question of how dynamical systems, i.e., systems whose behaviors change over time, can be effectively influenced. In the course, these two domains - controls and robotics - will be interleaved and we will go from the basics of control theory, via robotic examples of increasing complexity - all the way to the research frontier. The course will focus on mobile robots as the target application and problems that will be covered include (1) how to make (teams of) wheeled ground robots avoid collisions while reaching target locations, &nbsp;(2) how to make aerial, quadrotor robots follow paths in the presence of severe disturbances, and (3) how to locomotive bipedal, humanoid robots.<br><br>While the main focus of this course is theory, it is important to be able to map the theory onto an actual physical platform. As such, the course&nbsp;will provide detailed instructions on how to build a mobile robot from scratch as an optional part of the course. In addition, an introduction into microcontrollers, mechatronics, and electronics will be given so that, by the end of the course, the controllers developed in the course can run on an actual mobile robot.<br><br>The course will also feature optional programming assignments, which will&nbsp;focus on implementing the controllers developed in this course for a&nbsp;mobile robot. A MATLAB-based simulator will be available run controllers&nbsp;from the programming assignments on a simulated robot or on the mobile&nbsp;robot built in this course. As a result of support from MathWorks, a&nbsp;downloadable license for MATLAB and course recommended toolboxes will be&nbsp;available for the duration of the MOOC.<br>

Title:  Analytical Chemistry / Instrumental Analysis
Short desc:  If chemistry is the science of stuff, then analytical chemistry answers the question: what is it? And how much of it do you have? This course teaches how to do this with instrumental analysis! 
Long desc:  This course covers about a half a semester of instrumental analysis which is a standard part of the undergraduate chemistry curriculum. Any chemist has to understand how to analyze samples - whether they are water samples, blood samples or bits of a painting. Most often chemists do this using instruments of some sort. Machines like mass spectrometers or gas chromatographs can indicate both what's in a sample (qualitative) as well as how much of something there is(quantitative). If you are fascinated by shows like CSI, and have enough basic chemistry, this course would be great for you. However, the course is first and foremost designed for chemistry students working towards their degree.<br><div>Students who complete this class will understand that analytical instruments are not black boxes, but rather complex tools whose utility depends in detail on how analysts both configure and apply them. Towards that end there are three pimary objectives. First, students will learn facts about major classes of instruments commonly used in chemical analysis. Their knowledge will be captured by the ability to block diagram these complex pieces of equipment, and tailor the specifications to the measurement needs. Second, the course will cover the basics of instrumental calibration and quality control. Analysts will develop the ability to apply calibration curves, internal standards and the method of standard addition as needed for various measurement problems. Finally, students must learn how to select and tailor the best instrumental method given a particular measurement need. This higher level skill involves critical evaluation of the strengths and limitations of the various method, and the ability to understand the context behind a measurement need.</div>

Title:  Chemistry: Concept Development and Application
Short desc:  This introduction to fundamental chemical concepts of atomic and molecular structure will emphasize the development of these concepts from experimental observations and scientific reasoning.
Long desc:  This course will cover an introduction to the atomic molecular structure of matter, similar to a typical first semester General Chemistry course. &nbsp;The fundamental concepts will be introduced via the Concept Development Approach developed at Rice University and utilizing a free on-line textbook, Concept Development Studies in Chemistry, available via Rice’s Connexions project. &nbsp;In this approach, rather than simply telling you the concepts you need to know and then asking you to memorize them or apply them, we will develop these concepts from experimental observations and scientific reasoning. &nbsp;There are several reasons for using this approach. &nbsp;One reason is that most of us our inductive learners, meaning that we like to make specific observations and then generalize from there. &nbsp;Many of the most significant concepts in Chemistry are counter-intuitive. &nbsp;When we see where those concepts come from, we can more readily accept them, explain them, and apply them. A second reason is that scientific reasoning in general and Chemistry reasoning in particular are inductive processes. &nbsp;This Concept Development approach illustrates those reasoning processes. &nbsp;A third reason is that this is simply more interesting. &nbsp;The structure and reactions of matter are fascinating puzzles to be solved by observation and reasoning. &nbsp;It is more fun intellectually when we can solve those puzzles together, rather than simply have the answers to the riddles revealed at the outset.

Short desc:  Learn the fundamentals of digital signal processing theory and discover the myriad ways DSP makes everyday life more productive and fun.
Long desc:  The goal of the course is to develop a complete working set of digital signal processing notions from the ground up. DSP is arguably at the heart of the “digital revolution” that, in the space of just a few decades, has enabled unprecedented levels of interpersonal communication and of information availability. <br><br> In the class, starting from the basic definitions of a discrete-time signal, we will work our way through Fourier analysis, filter design, sampling, interpolation and quantization to build a DSP toolset complete enough to analyze a practical communication system in detail. Hands-on examples and demonstration will be routinely used to close the gap between theory and practice.

Title:  Critical Thinking in Global Challenges
Short desc:  In this course you will develop and enhance your ability to think critically, assess information and develop reasoned arguments in the context of the global challenges facing society today.
Long desc:  Critical thinking is the ability to gather and assess information and evidence in a balanced and reflective way to reach conclusions that are justified by reasoned argument based on the available evidence. Critical thinking is a key skill in the information age, valuable in all disciplines and professions. <br><br> This introductory course will give you the opportunity to better understand what critical thinking is, and to practice and enhance your critical thinking skills. To do so, we will use the context of some important global challenges that affect us all, and to which we have no clear “correct” solutions: for example, the risk and spread of serious infectious diseases in epidemics in modern societies, the implications of increasing human population on global resources, energy, environment and climate, and the challenges of human health and wellbeing in the modern world. Possible solutions to global issues such as these are hotly debated, and give the perfect setting to practice recognizing and evaluating facts, ideas, opinions and arguments. <br><br> The relevant background information for each global challenge will be provided to ensure that you can complete the exercises. Note, however, this course is not a course on these global challenges themselves; instead it uses the context of these thought-provoking challenges to practice critical thinking.<br><br><b>Subtitles for all video lectures available</b>:&nbsp;Portuguese (provided by the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.fundacaolemann.org.br/" target="_blank">Lemann Foundation</a>), English<br>

Title:  Data Analysis
Short desc:  Learn about the most effective data analysis methods to solve problems and achieve insight.
Long desc:  <div>You have probably heard that this is the era of “Big Data”. Stories about
    companies or scientists using data to recommend movies, discover who is
    pregnant based on credit card receipts, or confirm the existence of the
    Higgs Boson regularly appear in Forbes, the Economist, the Wall Street
    Journal, and The New York Times. But how does one turn data into this type
    of insight? The answer is data analysis and applied statistics. Data analysis
    is the process of finding the right data to answer your question, understanding
    the processes underlying the data, discovering the important patterns in
    the data, and then communicating your results to have the biggest possible
    impact. There is a critical shortage of people with these skills in the
    workforce, which is why Hal Varian (Chief Economist at Google) says that
    being a statistician will be the sexy job for the next 10 years.
    <br>
    <br>This course is an applied statistics course focusing on data analysis.
    The course will begin with an overview of how to organize, perform, and
    write-up data analyses. Then we will cover some of the most popular and
    widely used statistical methods like linear regression, principal components
    analysis, cross-validation, and p-values. Instead of focusing on mathematical
    details, the lectures will be designed to help you apply these techniques
    to real data using the R statistical programming language, interpret the
    results, and diagnose potential problems in your analysis. You will also
    have the opportunity to critique and assist your fellow classmates with
    their data analyses.</div>

It provides examples of how primary health care has been instrumental in approaching this goal in selected populations and how the principles of primary health care can guide future policies and actions.
Long desc:  Two of the most inspiring, least understood, and most often derided terms
in global health discourse are “Health for All” and “Primary Health Care.”
In this course, we will explore these terms in the context of global health,
their origins and meanings, the principles upon which they rest, and examples
of how these principles have been implemented both at small scale as well
as at large scale. We will also explore some ultra-low-cost approaches
to Health for All through primary health care and the promise that primary
health care holds for eventually achieving Health for All.

Title:  Community Change in Public Health
Short desc:  This course examines the community context of the changes needed to promote the public’s health.
Long desc:  <div>In bringing about behavior change in public health, we often focus on
    the individual mother, student, or farmer. We should not forget the community
    structure and norms constrain for encouraging individual health behaviors.
    This course examines the community context of the changes needed to promote
    the public’s health. We begin by examining the various definitions of ‘community’
    and the processes by which we ‘diagnose’ or seek to understand the structure
    and characteristics of different types of communities. An appreciation
    of community similarities and differences is necessary lest we fall into
    the trap of designing one-size-fits-all interventions. We need to recognize
    that no matter that outsiders may view a community as poor or neglected,
    we can find strengths and capacities for improvement in each community.
    Identifying community capacities and resources is the first step in facilitating
    community change. Different practical and philosophical approaches to change
    and therefore, examined. Specific to the change process is our recognition
    of the need for communities to participate in the design, implementation
    and evaluation of any intervention. We examine the concept of participation
    in an effort to see how different levels of involvement may affect sustainability
    of community change efforts. Finally a case study of a community participatory
    approach to onchocerciasis control in Africa is presented. Community Directed
    Intervention has subsequently been successfully applied to providing other
    essential primary health care services by and in the community, such as
    insecticide treated bednets, malaria treatment, vitamin A distribution,
    deworming medicines, and pneumonia and diarrhea case management.

Title:  Functional Programming Principles in Scala
Short desc:  Learn about functional programming, and how it can be effectively combined with object-oriented programming. Gain practice in writing clean functional code, using the Scala programming language.
Long desc:  This course introduces the cornerstones of functional programming using the Scala programming language. Functional programming has become more and more popular in recent years because it promotes code that’s safe, concise, and elegant. Furthermore, functional programming makes it easier to write parallel code for today’s and tomorrow’s multiprocessors by replacing mutable variables and loops with powerful ways to define and compose functions. <br><br> Scala is a language that fuses functional and object-oriented programming in a practical package. It interoperates seamlessly with Java and its tools. Scala is now used in a rapidly increasing number of open source projects and companies. It provides the core infrastructure for sites such as Twitter, LinkedIn, Foursquare, Tumblr, and Klout. <br><br> In this course you will discover the elements of the functional programming style and learn how to apply them usefully in your daily programming tasks. You will also develop a solid foundation for reasoning about functional programs, by touching upon proofs of invariants and the tracing of execution symbolically. <br><br> The course is hands on; most units introduce short programs that serve as illustrations of important concepts and invite you to play with them, modifying and improving them. The course is complemented by a series of assignments, most of which are also programming projects.

Title:  Astrobiology and the Search for Extraterrestrial Life
Short desc:  Learn about the origin and evolution of life and the search for life beyond the Earth.
Long desc:  Over two thousand years ago, the ancient Greeks wondered if there were other worlds in the cosmos. This question is now being experimentally tested. This course, offered by the UK Centre for Astrobiology at the University of Edinburgh,&nbsp;is an introduction to astrobiology and was the first MOOC to explore this subject. It explores the origin and evolution of life on the Earth and its potential to exist elsewhere. <br><br>Astrobiology addresses compelling questions of wide interest such as: How did life originate on the Earth? Is this an inevitable process and is life common across the Universe? Astrobiology is an interdisciplinary science that bridges fields as diverse as astrophysics, biology, geosciences and chemistry. <br><br> In this course we will explore what we know about life’s ability to live in extreme environments on the Earth, we will look at different hypotheses for how it originated. We will look at some of the missions to search for life in our own Solar System and on planets orbiting distant stars. We will discuss some of the extreme environments on the Earth that help us understand the limits of life and how life has adapted to cope with extremes. We will explore the possibility of intelligent alien life and some of the implications of its detection. The course will provide a foundation in astrobiology and introduce students to concepts in a diversity of scientific fields.

Title:  E-learning and Digital Cultures
Short desc:  This course will explore how digital cultures and learning cultures connect, and what this means for the ways in which we conduct education online. The course is not about how to ‘do’ e-learning; rather, it is an invitation to view online educational practices through a particular lens – that of popular and digital culture. Follow this course on Twitter at #edcmooc.
Long desc:  <p>E-learning and Digital Cultures is
aimed at teachers, learning technologists, and people with a general interest
in education who want to deepen their understanding of what it means to teach
and learn in the digital age. The course is about how digital cultures
intersect with learning cultures online, and how our ideas about online
education are shaped through “narratives”, or big stories, about the
relationship between people and technology. We’ll explore some of the most
engaging perspectives on digital culture in its popular and academic forms, and
we’ll consider how our practices as teachers and learners are informed by the
difference of the digital. We’ll look at how learning and literacy is
represented in popular digital-, (or cyber-) culture, and explore how that
connects with the visions and initiatives we are seeing unfold in our
approaches to digital education.</p>

<p>This course will not be taught via a
series of video lectures. Rather, a selection of rich resources will be provided
through which you can begin to engage with the themes of the course. While the
teachers will be present in the discussion forums and in various other media
environments, there will be an emphasis on learner-led group formation, and the
use of social media to build personal learning networks and communities of
peers. On this course, you will be invited to think critically and creatively
about e-learning both as a process and as a topic of study; you will be able to
try out new ideas in a supportive environment, and gain fresh perspectives on
your own experiences of teaching and learning. &nbsp;This course is also intended to be an exploration &nbsp;of the MOOC format itself. &nbsp;Rather than approaching this course with the expectation of exacting teaching methods or precise learning routines, we invite all participants to collectively experiment with what the MOOC experience might be.</p>

<p>The course assessment will involve you
creating your own digital artefact: something that is designed to be
experienced digitally, on the web. It will be likely to contain a mixture of text,
image, sound, video, links, and can be created in the environment of your
choice. The artefact will be a representation of any of the themes encountered during the course, and you‘ll have

Title:  High Performance Scientific Computing
Short desc:  Programming-oriented course on effectively using modern computers to solve scientific computing problems arising in the physical/engineering sciences and other fields. Provides an introduction to efficient serial and parallel computing using Fortran 90, OpenMP, MPI, and Python, and software development tools such as version control, Makefiles, and debugging.
Long desc:  <p>Computation and simulation are increasingly important in all aspects of
    science and engineering. At the same time writing efficient computer programs
    to take full advantage of current computers is becoming increasingly difficult.
    Even laptops now have 4 or more processors, but using them all to solve
    a single problem faster often requires rethinking the algorithm to introduce
    parallelism, and then programming in a language that can express this parallelism.&nbsp;
    Writing efficient programs also requires some knowledge of machine arithmetic,
    computer architecture, and memory hierarchies.</p>
<p>Although parallel computing will be covered, this is <i>not</i> a class
    on the most advanced techniques for using supercomputers, which these days
    have tens of thousands of processors and cost millions of dollars. Instead,
    the goal is to teach tools that you can use immediately on your own laptop,
    desktop, or a small cluster. Cloud computing will also be discussed, and
    students who don't have a multiprocessor computer of their own will still
    be able to do projects using Amazon Web Services at very low cost.</p>
<p>Along the way there will also be discussion of software engineering tools
    such as debuggers, unit testing, Makefiles, and the use of version control
    systems. After all, your time is more valuable than computer time, and
    a program that runs fast is totally useless if it produces the wrong results.</p>
<p>High performance <i>programming</i> is also an important aspect of high
    performance scientific computing, and so another main theme of the course
    is the use of basic tools and techniques to improve your efficiency as
    a computational scientist.</p>

Title:  The Hardware/Software Interface
Short desc:  Examines key computational abstraction levels below modern high-level languages. From Java/C to assembly programming, to basic processor and system organization.
Long desc:  This course examines key computational abstraction levels below modern
high-level languages; number representation, assembly language, introduction
to C, memory management, the operating-system process model, high-level
machine architecture including the memory hierarchy, and how high-level
languages are implemented. We will develop students’ sense of “what really
happens” when software runs — and that this question can be answered at
several levels of abstraction, including the hardware architecture level,
the assembly level, the C programming level and the Java programming level.
The core around which the course is built is C, assembly, and low-level
data representation, but this is connected to higher levels (roughly how
basic Java could be implemented), lower levels (the general structure of
a processor and the memory hierarchy), and the role of the operating system
(but not how the operating system is implemented).

Title:  Programming Languages
Short desc:  Investigate the basic concepts behind programming languages, with a strong emphasis on the techniques and benefits of functional programming. Use the programming languages ML, Racket, and Ruby in ways that will teach you how the pieces of a language fit together to create more than the sum of the parts. Gain new software skills and the concepts needed to learn new languages on your own.
Long desc:  Learn many of the concepts that underlie all programming languages. Develop
a programming style known as functional programming and contrast it with
object-oriented programming. Through experience writing programs and studying
three different languages, learn the key issues in designing and using
programming languages, such as modularity and the complementary benefits
of static and dynamic typing. This course is neither particularly theoretical
nor just about programming specifics – it will give you a framework for
understanding how to use language constructs effectively and how to design
correct and elegant programs. By using different languages, you learn to
think more deeply than in terms of the particular syntax of one language.
The emphasis on functional programming is essential for learning how to
write robust, reusable, composable, and elegant programs – in any language.

Title:  Principles of Economics for Scientists
Short desc:  Quantitative and model-based introduction to basic ideas in economics, and applications to a wide range of real world problems.
Long desc:  The impact of economic forces in our lives is sizable and pervasive. For this reason, it is impossible to understand the social and economic forces shaping our lives without a good understanding of basic economic principles. This course provides a quantitative and model-based introduction to such principles, and teaches how to apply them to make sense of a wide range of real world problems. Examples of applications include predicting the impact of technological changes in market prices, calculating the optimal gasoline tax, and measuring the value of new products. <br><br>This is a real Caltech class. It will be taught concurrently to Caltech and on-line students. This has two implications. On the costs side: the class is challenging, highly quantitative, and will demand significant effort. On the benefit side: successful completion of the class will provide you with an in-depth understanding of basic economics, and will permanently change the way you see the world.

Title:  A Beginner's Guide to Irrational Behavior
Short desc:  Behavioral economics couples scientific research on the psychology of decision making with economic theory to better understand what motivates financial decisions. In A Beginner’s Guide to Irrational Behavior, you will learn about some of the many ways in which we behave in less than rational ways, and how we might overcome our shortcomings. You’ll also learn about cases where our irrationalities work in our favor, and how we can harness these human tendencies to make better decisions.
Long desc:  This course will draw heavily on my own research, and pulls&nbsp;largely&nbsp;from my three books:&nbsp;<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Predictably-Irrational-Revised-Expanded-Edition/dp/0061353248/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1361031703&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=dan+ariely" target="_blank">Predictably Irrational</a>&nbsp;(2008),&nbsp;<a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Upside-Irrationality-Unexpected-Benefits/dp/0061995045/ref=tmm_pap_title_0?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1361031759&amp;sr=8-6" target="_blank">The Upside of Irrationality</a>&nbsp;(2010), and&nbsp;<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Honest-Truth-About-Dishonesty-Everyone---Especially/dp/0062183591/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1361031810&amp;sr=8-3&amp;keywords=dan+ariely" target="_blank">The Honest Truth About Dishonesty</a>&nbsp;(2012).&nbsp;We will examine topics such as our “irrational” patterns of thinking about money and investments, how expectations shape perception, economic and psychological analyses of dishonesty by honest people, how social and financial incentives work together (or against each other) in labor, how self-control comes into play with decision making, and how emotion (rather than cognition) can have a large impact on economic decisions.&nbsp;This highly interdisciplinary course will be relevant to all human beings. <br><br><div><strong>The goals of this class:</strong></div><ol><li>Introduce you to the range of cases where people (consumers, investors, managers, friends, significant others, and even you) might make decisions that are inconsistent with standard economic theory and the assumptions of rational decision making. This is the lens of behavioral economics.</li><li>Help you think creatively about the applications of behavioral economics to the development of new products, technologies and public policy, and to understand how business and social policy strategies could be modified with a deeper understanding of the effects these principles have on all of us.</li></ol>

Title:  Computational Photography
Short desc:  In this course you will learn about the basics of how computation has impacted the entire workflow of photography (i.e., from how images are captured, manipulated and collaborated on, and shared).
Long desc:  The goal of this course is to introduce you to the basics of how computation
has impacted the entire workflow of photography (i.e., from how images
are captured, manipulated and collaborated on, and shared). &nbsp;
<br>
<br>The course begins with a conceptualization of&nbsp;photography as drawing
with light and the capturing of light to form images/videos. &nbsp;You
will learn about and understand how the optics and the sensor within a
camera are generalized, as well as learn about and understand how the lighting
and other aspects of the environment are also generalized through computation
to capture novel images.&nbsp;
<br>
<br>Pre- and post-processing techniques used to manipulate and improve images
will be discussed. &nbsp;Activities in this course are selected to give
you first hand experience with the power of the web and the Internet for
both analyzing and sharing images. &nbsp;
<br>
<br>This course is interdisciplinary and draws upon concepts and principles
from computer vision, computer graphics, image processing, mathematics
and optics.
<br>
<br>We look forward to your engagement and participation with both the course
and its discussion forums.

Long desc:  This course will introduce you to some of the main areas of research in contemporary philosophy. Each week a different philosopher will talk you through some of the most important questions and issues in their area of expertise. We’ll begin by trying
to understand what philosophy is – what are its characteristic aims and methods, and how does it differ from other subjects? Then we’ll spend the rest of the course gaining an introductory overview of several different areas of philosophy. Topics you’ll
learn about will include:
<br>
<br>
<ul>
    <li>Epistemology, where we’ll consider what our knowledge of the world and ourselves consists in, and how we come to have it;</li>
    <li>Philosophy of science, where we’ll investigate foundational conceptual issues in scientific research and practice;</li>
    <li>Philosophy of Mind, where we’ll ask questions about what it means for something to have a mind, and how minds should be understood and explained;</li>
    <li>Moral Philosophy, where we’ll attempt to understand the nature of our moral judgements and reactions – whether they aim at some objective moral truth, or are mere personal or cultural preferences, and;</li>
    <li>Metaphysics, where we’ll think through some fundamental conceptual questions about the nature of reality.</li>

Title:  Design: Creation of Artifacts in Society
Short desc:  Combine fundamental concepts with hands-on design challenges to become a better designer.

Long desc:  This is a course aimed at making you a better designer. The course marries theory and practice, as both are valuable in improving design performance. Lectures and readings will lay out the fundamental concepts that underpin design as a human activity.
Weekly design challenges test your ability to apply those ideas to solve real problems. The course is deliberately broad - spanning all domains of design, including architecture, graphics, services, apparel, engineered goods, and products. The emphasis
of the course is the basic design process: define, explore, select, and refine. You, the student, bring to the course your particular interests and expertise related to, for instance, engineering, furniture, fashion, architecture, or products. In prior
sessions of the course about half of the participants were novices and about half had prior professional design expertise. Both groups seem to benefit substantially from the course. All project work is evaluated by your peers -- and indeed, you will also
be a peer reviewer. This format allows you to see an interesting collection of projects while getting useful feedback on your own project.
<br>
<br><b>Student Testimonials from Earlier Sessions of the Course:</b>
<br>
<span>"An amazing course - a joy to take. I will really miss checking in every
    week to see the latest. I learned a great deal, from the videos, [the course staff] and my fellow
    students. I think getting the feedback from my peers was such a great way
    to run the course. So many ideas, suggestions, thoughts and words of encouragement
    that were so appreciated. I've been driving everyone I know talking about it all the time." &nbsp;--E. Wadsworth-Jones
<br>
<br>"When I signed up for this course I didn't know what to expect; the experience
was so good and rewarding. I just loved it every step of the way. The course
was brilliant, challenging and fun! Our professor, Prof. Karl Ulrich, is
an amazing teacher, I loved his down to Earth approach.  Participating in a tournament was also one of the course's highlights. The whole thing was a great, unforgettable experience. I wish to thank with all my heart Coursera and the University of Pennsylvania for the opportunity given
to us."

Title:  An Introduction to Operations Management
Short desc:  This course will teach you how to analyze and improve business processes, be it in services or in manufacturing. You will learn how to improve productivity, how to provide more choice to customers, how to reduce response times, and how to improve quality.
Long desc:  <p><b>PART OF THE WHARTON FOUNDATION SERIES</b>&nbsp;
</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Remember the last time you went to a restaurant. What did you expect from that restaurant? You wanted to find something on the menu that you liked, you wanted the meal to be prepared according to high quality standards, you wanted to get it quickly and
    didn’t want to pay too much money for it. Now, remember the last time you went to a doctor’s office or a hospital. What did you want the doctors and nurses to do? You wanted them to provide the right care for you, you wanted the care delivered with
    great quality, you wanted to get the care quickly, and you (or your insurance) didn’t want to pay too much for it.
    <br>
    <br>Put differently, the management skills that you need to run the operations of a restaurant are the same that you need to run a hospital. And these are the skills you will learn in this course. Specifically, you will learn how to improve productivity,
    increase responsiveness, provide more choice to the customer, and deliver higher quality standards. In short, you will learn how to analyze business processes and how to improve them. Along the way, you will learn about topics such as Lean Operations,
    Six Sigma, and the Toyota production system, you will hear about bottlenecks, flows rates, and inventory levels. And, much, much more.</p>

Title:  Introduction to Sociology
Short desc:  In this class we will cover the essentials of sociology, to help you better understand your own life and situations far from your experience.
Long desc:  We live in a world that is changing very quickly. Sociology gives us the tools to understand our own lives and those quite remote from us. The premise of this class is that in order to benefit from the sociological perspective, we need to learn how to ask certain basic questions. We need to know how to seek answers through methods that strive to be systematic and generalizable.We will begin with some of the essential questions: How are the things that we take to be natural socially constructed? How do we live today? How determined is social life? Does the individual make a difference? How is social order possible? Then we will ask what techniques are available to make sense of these questions.  We will review comparative, historical, demographic, experimental, and ethnographic methods. Along the way, we will study core concepts including ethnocentrism, social networks, community, unanticipated consequences, social capital, race, class, and gender. <br><br> We will strive to understand how interaction in micro-level contexts affects larger social processes and how such macro-level processes influence our day to day lives. We will learn to conceive of inequality by asking how race, class, and gender work in tandem. We will address one of the crises of recent sociology -- whether we can actually isolate the effects of social context. We will think about how social science is changing at a time when we are literally swimming in oceans of data generated by the internet.

Short desc:  In this course you will learn several fundamental principles of advanced algorithm design: greedy algorithms and applications; dynamic programming and applications; NP-completeness and what it means for the algorithm designer; the design and analysis of heuristics; and more.
Long desc:  <div>In this course you will learn several fundamental principles of advanced algorithm design. You'll learn the greedy algorithm design paradigm, with applications to computing good network backbones (i.e., spanning trees) and good codes for data compression. You'll learn the tricky yet widely applicable dynamic programming algorithm design paradigm, with applications to routing in the Internet and sequencing genome fragments. &nbsp;You’ll learn what NP-completeness and the famous “P vs. NP” problem mean for the algorithm designer. &nbsp;Finally, we’ll study several strategies for dealing with hard (i.e., NP-complete problems), including the design and analysis of heuristics. &nbsp;Learn how shortest-path algorithms from the 1950s (i.e., pre-ARPANET!) govern the way that your Internet traffic gets routed today; why efficient algorithms are fundamental to modern genomics; and how to make a million bucks in prize money by “just” solving a math problem!</div>

Title:  Compilers
Short desc:  This course will discuss the major ideas used today in the implementation of programming language compilers. You will learn how a program written in a high-level language designed for humans is systematically translated into a program written in low-level assembly more suited to machines!
Long desc:  <p>This course will discuss the major ideas used today in the implementation of programming language compilers, including lexical analysis, parsing, syntax-directed translation, abstract syntax trees, types and type checking, intermediate languages, dataflow analysis, program optimization, code generation, and runtime systems. As a result, you will learn how a program written in a high-level language designed for humans is systematically translated into a program written in low-level assembly more suited to machines. Along the way we will also touch on how programming languages are designed, programming language semantics, and why there are so many different kinds of programming languages.</p>
<p>The course lectures will be presented in short videos. To help you master the material, there will be in-lecture questions to answer, quizzes, and two exams: a midterm and a final. There will also be homework in the form of exercises that ask you to show a sequence of logical steps needed to derive a specific result, such as the sequence of steps a type checker would perform to type check a piece of code, or the sequence of steps a parser would perform to parse an input string. This checking technology is the result of ongoing research at Stanford into developing innovative tools for education, and we're excited to be the first course ever to make it available to students.</p>
An optional course project is to write a complete compiler for COOL, the Classroom Object Oriented Language. COOL has the essential features of a realistic programming language, but is small and simple enough that it can be implemented in a few thousand lines of code. Students who choose to do the project can implement it in either C++ or Java.<br>I hope you enjoy the course!
<p><strong>Why Study Compilers?</strong></p>
Everything that computers do is the result of some program, and all of the millions of programs in the world are written in one of the many thousands of programming languages that have been developed over the last 60 years. Designing and implementing a programming language turns out to be difficult; some of the best minds in computer science have thought about the problems involved and contributed beautiful and deep results. Learning something about compilers will show you the interplay of theory and practice in computer science, especially how powerful general ideas combined with engineering insight can lead to practical solutions to very hard problems. Knowing how a compiler works will also make you a better programmer and increase your ability to learn new programming languages quickly.

Title:  Computer Science 101
Short desc:  CS101 teaches the essential ideas of Computer Science for a zero-prior-experience audience. The course uses small coding experiments in the browser to play with the nature of computers, understanding their strengths and limitations. Sign up for the "To be announced" session to be notified by email when the class is next run, and sign up for "Self-Study" to start browsing the class materials right away. Self-Study mode makes all the videos and assignments available to be done at your own pace, but without a certificate of completion at the end.
Long desc:  <p>CS101 teaches the essential ideas of Computer Science for a zero-prior-experience audience. Computers can appear very complicated, but in reality, computers work within just a few, simple patterns. CS101 demystifies and brings those patterns to life, which is useful for anyone using computers today.</p>
<p>In CS101, students play and experiment with short bits of "computer code" to bring to life to the power and limitations of computers. Everything works within the browser, so there is no extra software to download or install. CS101 also provides a general background on computers today: what is a computer, what is hardware, what is software, what is the internet. No previous experience is required other than the ability to use a web browser.</p>

Title:  VLSI CAD:  Logic to Layout
Short desc:  A modern VLSI chip has a zillion parts -- logic, control, memory, interconnect, etc.  How do we design these complex chips?  Answer: CAD software tools.  Learn how to build these tools in this class.
Long desc:  <div>A modern VLSI chip is a remarkably complex beast: &nbsp;billions of transistors, millions of logic gates deployed for computation and control, big blocks of memory, embedded blocks of pre-designed functions designed by third parties (called “intellectual property” or IP blocks). &nbsp;How do people manage to design these complicated chips? &nbsp;Answer: &nbsp;a sequence of computer aided design (CAD) tools takes an abstract description of the chip, and refines it step-wise to a final design. This class focuses on the major design tools used in the creation of an Application Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC) or System on Chip (SoC) design. &nbsp;Our focus is on the key representations that make it possible to synthesize, and to verify, these designs, as they move from logic to layout. &nbsp; <br><br>Our goal is for students to understand how the tools themselves work, at the level of their fundamental algorithms and data structures. You should be taking this course if (1) you are interested in building VLSI design tools; &nbsp;(2) you are interested in designing VLSI chips, and you want to know why the tools do what they do; &nbsp;(3) you just like cool algorithms, that work on big cool problems that involve bits, and gates, and geometry, and graphs, and matrices, and time, and...</div>

Title:  Heterogeneous Parallel Programming
Short desc:  This course introduces concepts, languages, techniques, and patterns for programming heterogeneous, massively parallel processors. Its contents and structure have been significantly revised based on the experience gained from its initial offering in 2012. It covers heterogeneous computing architectures, data-parallel programming models, techniques for memory bandwidth management, and parallel algorithm patterns.
Long desc:  <p>All computing
systems, from mobile to supercomputers, are becoming heterogeneous, massively
parallel computers for higher power efficiency and computation
throughput. While the computing community is racing to build tools and
libraries to ease the use of these systems, effective and confident
use of these systems will always require knowledge about low-level
programming in these systems. This course is designed for students to
learn the essence of low-level programming interfaces and how to use these
interfaces to achieve application goals. CUDA C, with its good balance between
user control and verboseness, will serve as the teaching vehicle for the first
half of the course. Students will then extend their learning into closely
related programming interfaces such as OpenCL, OpenACC, and C++AMP.</p>

<p><span><br>
The course is unique in that it is application oriented and only introduces the
necessary underlying computer science and computer engineering knowledge for
understanding. It covers the concept of data parallel execution models,
memory models for managing locality, tiling techniques for reducing bandwidth
consumption, parallel algorithm patterns, overlapping computation with
communication, and a variety of
heterogeneous parallel programming interfaces. The concepts learned in this
course form a strong foundation for learning other types of parallel
programming systems.</span></p>

Title:  The Modern World: Global History since 1760
Short desc:  This is a survey of modern history from a global perspective. It begins with the revolutions of the late 1700s, tracks the transformation of the world during the 1800s, and analyzes the cataclysms of last century, concluding with the new phase of world history we are experiencing today.
Long desc:  <p>This is a survey course in modern world history for
students, beginning or advanced, who wish to better understand how the world
got to be the way it is today. In order to understand modern history, a global
perspective is essential. This is true whether you are interested in economics,
warfare, philosophy, politics, or even pop culture. This course can therefore
be essential for students in many fields, a base equipping them with tools for
lifelong learning.  </p><p><br></p>

<p>In its current form, this course on Coursera is not offered
for college credit. But it is a vital part of the for credit course on this
topic being offered at the University of Virginia in the spring semester of
2014. Both the Coursera and the UVA students use the same online material as
a common foundation for their different learning experiences.  This is the material to survey 'what
happened' and the big questions about how to explain so many changes – some of
those questions that start with: 
"Why?"  (The students in
the UVA course then supplement this online material with a lot of additional
reading; research projects on the histories of particular communities around
the world; in-person tutorials and discussions, both with the professor and with the graduate teaching assistants; and examinations.) </p><p><br></p>

<p>It is tempting to think that if we can just understand the
big patterns, we don't have to get too caught up in the details. In this
course, though, we care about chronology. We care about individuals. Without some
careful attention to sequences of cause and effect, without tracing how big
changes come from the choices made by particular people, history can turn into
just a series of descriptions, a somewhat tiresome recitation of one thing
after another. So beyond just offering a set of remarkable stories, this course offers you training in how to
analyze a situation and how to think about problems of explaining change.</p>

Title:  How Things Work 1
Short desc:  An introduction to physics in the context of everyday objects.
Long desc:  <div>Designed for non-science students, this course is a practical 
introduction to physics and science in everyday life. It considers 
objects from the world around us, identifying and exploring the 
scientific concepts upon which they're based. Because it starts with 
objects and looks within them for science, it is the reverse of a 
traditional physics class. Instead of the usual principle-driven physics
 class, How Things Work is case-study physics. In this pilot semester of
 How Things Work, we will explore the basic laws of motion in the 
context of six familiar objects or activities: (1) Skating, (2) Falling 
Balls, (3) Ramps, (4) Seesaws, (5) Wheels, and (6) Bumper Cars. Despite 
their simplicity, these topics will bring us in contact with some of the
 most important concepts in physics, including inertia, energy, and 
momentum.</div>

Title:  Introduction to Sustainability
Short desc:  This course introduces the academic discipline of sustainability and explores how today’s human societies can endure in the face of global change, ecosystem degradation and resource limitations.
Long desc:  <div>This course introduces the academic approach of Sustainability and explores how today’s human societies can endure in the face of global change, ecosystem degradation and resource limitations. The course focuses on key knowledge areas of sustainability theory and practice, including population, ecosystems, global change, energy, agriculture, water, environmental economics and policy, ethics, and cultural history.<br><br></div>
<div>This subject is of vital importance, seeking as it does to uncover the principles of the long-term welfare of all the peoples of the planet. As sustainability is a cross-disciplinary field of study, this foundation requires intellectual breadth: as I describe it in the class text, understanding our motivations requires the humanities, measuring the challenges of sustainability requires knowledge of the sciences (both natural and social), and building solutions requires technical insight into systems (such as provided by engineering, planning, and management).</div>

Title:  Planet Earth
Short desc:  Planet Earth, an overview of geology, discusses how earthquakes, volcanoes, mountain building, floods, ice ages, evolution, climate, and plate tectonics have interacted over deep time to produce a our dynamic island in space, and its unique landscapes.
Long desc:  Earthquakes, volcanoes, mountain building, ice ages, landslides, floods, life evolution, plate motions—all of these phenomena have interacted over the vast expanses of deep time to sculpt the dynamic planet that we live on today.  Planet Earth presents an overview of our home, from a geological perspective.  We learn how the elements comprising the Earth formed in the guts of stars and supernovae, how Earth and its Solar System neighbors formed from a vast cloud of gas and dust over 4.5 billion years ago.  And how the atmosphere, oceans, and rocks of our planet form and change.  We will emphasize how plate tectonics—the grand unifying theory of geology—explains how the map of our planet's surface has changed radically over geologic time, and why as present-day geologic activity—including a variety of devastating natural disasters—occur where they do.  We will also discuss the fascinating interactions and exchanges that take place among land, sea, air, and life, and how these interactions they result in the great variety of landscapes—from deserts to glaciers—that make our planet unique, and influence climate change in the past and, potentially the future.  Finally, we will delve into the processes that produce the energy and mineral resources that modern society depends on, to help understand the context of the environment and sustainability challenges that we will face in the future.

Title:  Microeconomics Principles
Short desc:  Introduction to the functions of individual decision-makers, both consumers and producers, within the larger economic system. Primary emphasis on the nature and functions of product markets, the theory of the firm under varying conditions of competition and monopoly, and the role of government in promoting efficiency in the economy.
Long desc:  <h2>Why 3 Versions?</h2>

<p><b>Note</b>: In January 2014 we will offer 3 versions of this course so
    that you can choose a version that best meets your needs. Two of the versions
    are identical except for the duration of the course. The third version
    is both shorter and covers slightly less material, focusing on just the most critical
    aspects of microeconomics principles. See further below for more details
    about the differences.</p>

<h2>About the Course</h2>

<p>Most people make the incorrect assumption that economics is ONLY the study
    of money.  My primary goal in this course is to shatter this belief.
     In fact, in the last 50 years economists have tackled some of the
    most interesting and important questions for humanity.  For instance,
    the following are just a few examples:</p>
<div>
    <ul>
        <li>About Love and Marriage
            <ul>
                <li>Why is the divorce rate so high and what should we do in order to reduce
                    it?</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>About the Environment
            <ul>
                <li>Why do we have so much pollution?</li>
                <li>How much is an endangered species worth?</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            <div>About Crime</div>
            <div>
                <ul>
                    <li>Would legalizing marijuana lead to a reduction in crime?</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
        </li>
        <li>
            <div>About Labor Markets</div>
            <div>
                <ul>
                    <li>Does increasing the Federal Minimum Wage put people out of work?</li>
                    <li>Why did so many women enter the labor force during the last 40 years?</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
        </li>
        <li>
            <div>About things you should be worrying about</div>
            <div>
                <ul>
                    <li>Why is a college education a smart investment? Or isn't?</li>
                    <li>Why are the presidential candidates missing the point on college costs?</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
        </li>
        <li>
            <div>And about many other things:</div>
            <div>
                <ul>
                    <li>Would school vouchers lead to improvements in public education?</li>
                    <li>Why a draft would only damage the army?</li>
                    <li>How to level the playing field in baseball?</li>
                    <li>AND, why is COURSERA offering this course free of charge?</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
        </li>
    </ul>
</div>
<p>Additional questions we will consider:</p>
<ul>
<li>What economists do and the strange way they think? (Basic Concepts, Modeling and Trade)</li>
<li>What determines prices and quantity
    in a market economy? (Supply and Demand)</li>
<li>What is the relationship between
    free market economies and social welfare? (Market Efficiency and Government
    Intervention)</li>
<li>What are the distributional effects
    of taxes? (Elasticity and Taxes)</li>
<li>What is the relationship between
    production and costs in a firm? (Production and Costs)</li>
<li>How competitive firms choose their
    efficient level of output? (Competitive Output)</li>
<li>What are the pricing policies of
    firms with some degree of market power? (Firms With Market Power)</li>
<li>How much pollution is too much pollution?
    (Public Goods, Common Resources and Externalities)</li>
<p>We will be addressing many of these (and many more) questions
during this course. Again, my main goal will to show you the way economists
think and how to use this analytical system to answer questions related
not only to these and other important human issues but pretty much to anything
you end up doing with your life after this class. After all, as you will
quickly find out, I believe everything is economics!</p></ul>

Title:  Grow to Greatness: Smart Growth for Private Businesses, Part I
Short desc:  This course focuses on the common growth challenges faced by existing private businesses when they attempt to grow substantially.
Long desc:  <div>Most entrepreneurship courses focus on how to start a business. Few focus on the next big entrepreneurial inflection point: how do you successfully grow an existing private business? This is the focus of this Course. It is based on the instructor's research and thirty years of real-world experience advising private growth companies.&nbsp;</div>
<div></div>
<br>
<div>This Course will challenge how you think about growth; give you tools to help you plan for growth, assess the preconditions to grow, and manage the risks of growth. You will study stories of how five different private businesses faced their growth challenges.&nbsp;</div>
<div></div>
<br>
<div>Growth, if not properly managed, can overwhelm a business, destroying value and in many cases even causing the business to fail. However, the research shows that every growth business faces common challenges. You can learn from others' experience—you do not have to "reinvent the wheel".</div>
<div></div>
<br>
<div>The Course format is case based. Each case tells a compelling story. You will learn from Julie Allinson, Susan Fellers, Dave Lindsey, Parik Laxinarayan and Eric Barger. In addition, each week, we will discuss a different content theme. In Weeks and 2 and 5, you will engage in Workshops where you will be asked to use and apply the Course tools and concepts to create growth strategies for two different real-life businesses. You will have the opportunity to create a Course Community of fellow-students to learn from each other as the Course progresses.&nbsp;</div>
<div></div>
<br>
<div>You will learn about the: "3 Myths of Growth"; the "Truth About Growth"; &nbsp;why growth is like "Mother Nature"; the "Gas Pedal" approach to growth; the all important "4 Ps" of how to grow; and how to scale a business strategically.</div>

Title:  Drugs and the Brain
Short desc:  The neuroscience of drugs for therapy, for prevention, and for recreation.  Drug addiction and drug abuse. You’ll learn the prospects for new generations of medications in neurology, psychiatry, aging, and treatment of substance abuse.

Long desc:  What happens in the body when a person smokes a cigarette? After several weeks of smoking? When a person takes antidepressant or antipsychotic medication? A drug for pain, migraine, or epilepsy? A recreational drug? Neuroscientists are beginning to understand these processes. You’ll learn how drugs enter the brain, how they act on receptors and ion channels, and how “molecular relay races” lead to changes in nerve cells and neural circuits that far outlast the drugs themselves. “Drugs and the Brain” also describes how scientists are gathering the knowledge required for the next steps in preventing or alleviating Parkinson’s, Alzheimer’s, schizophrenia, and drug abuse.

Title:  Web Intelligence and Big Data
Short desc:  This course is about building 'web-intelligence' applications exploiting big data sources arising social media, mobile devices and sensors, using new big-data platforms based on the 'map-reduce' parallel programming paradigm. During the fall semester this course is offered at the Indian Institute of Technology Delhi as well as the Indraprastha Institute of Information Technology Delhi. 
Long desc:  The past decade has witnessed the successful of application of many AI techniques used at `web-scale’, on what are popularly referred to as big data platforms based on the map-reduce parallel computing paradigm and associated technologies such as distributed file systems, no-SQL databases and stream computing engines. Online advertising, machine translation, natural language understanding, sentiment mining, personalized medicine, and national security are some examples of such AI-based web-intelligence applications that are already in the public eye. Others, though less apparent, impact the operations of large enterprises from sales and marketing to manufacturing and supply chains. In this course we explore some such applications, the AI/statistical techniques that make them possible, along with parallel implementations using map-reduce and related platforms.

Title:  Organizational Analysis
Short desc:  In this introductory course, you will learn multiple theories of organizational behavior and apply them to actual cases of organizational change.
Long desc:  It is hard to imagine living in modern society without participating in or interacting with organizations. The ubiquity and variability of organizations means there is ample room for complexity and confusion in the organizational challenges we regularly
face. Through this course, students will consider cases describing various organizational struggles: school systems and politicians attempting to implement education reforms; government administrators dealing with an international crisis; technology firms
trying to create a company ethos that sustains worker commitment; and even two universities trying to gain international standing by performing a merger.
<br>
<br>Each case is full of details and complexity. So how do we make sense of organizations and the challenges they face, let alone develop means of managing them in desired directions? While every detail can matter, some matter more than others. This is why
we rely on organizational theories -- to focus our attention and draw out relevant features in a sensible way.
<br>
<br>Through this course you will come to see that there is nothing more practical than a good theory. Every week, you’ll learn a different organizational theory, and it will become a lens through which you can interpret concrete organizational situations.
Armed with a toolset of theories, you will then be able to systematically identify important features of an organization and the events transforming it – and use the theories to predict which actions will best redirect the organization in a desired direction.<br><br>Join your future classmates and course alumni on&nbsp;<a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/219602578167354/" target="_blank" title="Link: https://www.facebook.com/groups/219602578167354/">Facebook</a>!<br>

Title:  Image and video processing: From Mars to Hollywood with a stop at the hospital
Short desc:  In this class you will look behind the scenes of image and video processing, from the basic and classical tools to the most modern and advanced algorithms.
Long desc:  What is image and video processing? Images and videos are everywhere, from those we take with our mobile devices and share with our friends to those that we receive from Mars and the ones we see in the movie theatre, without forgetting the whole ensemble of images of our bodies that are taken in hospital visits. Image and video processing is the art of working with such images and movies, from making it possible to store and transmit them to making those dark and blurry images look nice, as well as interpreting and analyzing the medical data and recognizing our friends’ faces in social pictures. This discipline is also fascinating because it uses tools from many areas of applied mathematics. In this class you will look behind the scenes of image and video processing, from the basic and classical tools to the most modern and advanced algorithms.<br><br> The course will start with an introduction to the basics of image formation and the fundamental concepts that translate a physical scene into a digital image. We will then describe the underlying concepts of image compression, the enabling technology that makes it possible for images to be sent from Mars and videos to be stored in our mobile phones. We will cover the most fundamental tools in image enhancement, showing how simple tools can significantly improve images. Both geometric and non-geometric tools as well as spatial and non-spatial operations will be presented. Details on image segmentation will be provided, one of the most fundamental and useful problems in image processing. The above topics will be extended to color images and video. Once we have covered the fundamentals, which both provide the basis for modern image and video processing and serve many important applications until today, we will move into recent progress in the area, covering image inpainting (how to remove objects from images and video), image processing via sparse modeling and compressed sensing, geometric partial differential equations for image analysis, image processing for HIV and virus research, and image processing for neurosurgery and other medical applications.

Title:  Grow to Greatness: Smart Growth for Private Businesses, Part II
Short desc:  This course focuses on the common human resource ("people") challenges faced by existing private businesses when they attempt to grow substantially. PART 1 OF THE GROW TO GREATNESS COURSE IS NOT A PREREQUISITE FOR TAKING THIS COURSE.
Long desc:  <div>Most entrepreneurship courses focus on how to start a business. Few focus
    on the next big entrepreneurial inflection point: how do you successfully
    grow an existing private business? This is the focus of this Course. It
    is based on the instructor's research and thirty years of real-world experience
    advising private growth companies.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>This Course will focus on the common “people” challenges private growth
    companies face as they grow. You will study stories of how six different
    private businesses faced their growth challenges.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>While strategic focus and operational excellence are necessary to build
    a great growth company, they are not sufficient. Growth requires the right
    kind of leadership, culture, and people. My research clearly showed that
    many entrepreneurs struggle with personal challenges presented to them
    by growth, as well as the challenge of hiring the right people and building
    the right management team that can play well together. The research shows
    that every growth business faces common challenges. You can learn from
    others' experience—you do not have to "reinvent the wheel".</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>The Course format is story based. Each case tells a compelling story.
    You will learn from Barbara Lynch, Ryan Dienst, Steve Ritter, Randy Bufford,
    John Gabbert, and Mike Cote. In addition, each week, we will discuss a
    different content theme. In Week 3, you will engage in a Workshop where
    you will be asked to apply the Growth System Assessment Tool. You will
    have the opportunity to create a Course Community of fellow students to
    learn from each other as the Course progresses.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>

Title:  Women and the Civil Rights Movement
Short desc:  Learn about women’s roles in the U.S. civil rights struggles of the 1890s to the 1990s. 
Long desc:  This
course examines the U.S. civil rights movement from the vantage point of women,
considering both women’s involvement in the legal campaigns and political
protests and the impact of civil rights struggles on women’s status and
identity.&nbsp; Taking a “long civil rights
movement” perspective, we begin in the late nineteenth century and consider
events, organizations, and personalities through the twentieth century. <br><br>Throughout
we will consider issues which have preoccupied historians, social movement
theorists, and historians alike:&nbsp;
developing and sustaining political commitment, assessing the strengths
and weaknesses of various forms of political organization, maximizing influence
and securing long-range objectives.&nbsp; We
will also examine competing definitions of leadership; class, race, and gender
dynamics within the movement; and the cultural dynamics of political organizing
and social change.&nbsp; <br><br>In the process, we
consider not only how the movement altered the status of African Americans in
the U.S. but the legacy of these struggles as they changed understandings of
citizenship and rights more broadly. &nbsp;&nbsp;Our concern throughout the course will be to
not only understand the historical narrative but also to see how historians
work to make sense of the past.<br>

Title:  Exploring Quantum Physics
Short desc:  An introduction to quantum physics with emphasis on topics at the frontiers of research, and developing understanding through exercise.
Long desc:  <p>Quantum
physics is the foundation for much of modern technology, provides the framework
for understanding light and matter from the subatomic to macroscopic domains,
and makes possible the most precise measurements ever made.&nbsp; More than just a theory, it offers a way of
looking at the world that grows richer with experience and practice.&nbsp; Our course will provide some of that practice and teach 
you "tricks of the trade" (not found in textbooks) that will enable you 
to solve quantum-mechanical problems yourself and understand the subject
 at a deeper level.</p>

<p>The
basic principles of quantum physics are actually quite simple, but they lead to
astonishing outcomes. &nbsp;Two examples that
we will look at from various perspectives are the prediction of the laser by
Albert Einstein in 1917 and the prediction of antimatter by Paul Dirac in 1928.&nbsp; Both of these predictions came from very
simple arguments in quantum theory, and led to results that transformed science
and society.&nbsp; Another familiar
phenomenon, magnetism, had been known since antiquity, but only with the advent
of quantum physics was it understood how magnets worked, to a degree that made
possible the discovery in the 1980’s of ultrastrong rare-earth magnets.&nbsp; However, lasers, antimatter and magnets are
areas of vibrant research, and they are all encountered in the new field of
ultracold atomic physics that will provide much of the material of “Exploring
Quantum Physics”.</p>

<p>Richard
Feynman once said, “I think I can safely say that nobody understands quantum
mechanics.”&nbsp; We say, that’s no reason not
to try! What Feynman was referring to are some of the “spooky” phenomena like quantum entanglement, which are incomprehensible from the standpoint of classical physics. Even though they have been thoroughly tested by experiment, and are even being exploited for applications such as cryptography and logic processing, they still seem so counterintuitive that they give rise to extraordinary ideas such as the many-world theory. Quantum physics combines
a spectacular record of discovery and predictive success, with foundational
perplexities so severe that even Albert Einstein came to believe that it was
wrong.&nbsp; This is what makes it such an
exciting area of science!</p><br>

Title:  Machine Learning
Short desc:  Why write programs when the computer can instead learn them from data? In this class you will learn how to make this happen, from the simplest machine learning algorithms to quite sophisticated ones. Enjoy!
Long desc:  <div>Machine learning algorithms can figure out how to perform important tasks by generalizing from examples. This is often feasible and cost-effective when manual programming is not. Machine learning (also known as data mining, pattern recognition and predictive analytics) is used widely in business, industry, science and government, and &nbsp;there is a great shortage of experts in it. If you pick up a machine learning textbook you may find it forbiddingly mathematical, but in this class you will learn that the key ideas and algorithms are in fact quite intuitive. And powerful!</div><div><br></div><div>Most of the class will be devoted to supervised learning (in other words, learning in which a teacher provides the learner with the correct answers at training time). This is the most mature and widely used type of machine learning. We will cover the main supervised learning techniques, including decision trees, rules, instances, Bayesian techniques, neural networks, model ensembles, and support vector machines. We will also touch on learning theory with an emphasis on its practical uses. Finally, we will cover the two main classes of unsupervised learning methods: clustering and dimensionality reduction. Throughout the class there will be an emphasis not just on individual algorithms but on ideas that cut across them and tips for making them work.</div><div><br></div><div>In the class projects you will build your own implementations of machine learning algorithms and apply them to problems like spam filtering, clickstream mining, recommender systems, and computational biology. This will get you as close to becoming a machine learning expert as you can in ten weeks!</div><div><br></div>

Title:  Software Defined Networking
Short desc:  In this course, you will learn about software defined networking and how it is changing the way communications networks are managed, maintained, and secured.
Long desc:  <span>
 <span><span>
  <span>
  <p>This
  course introduces software defined networking, an emerging paradigm in
  computer networking that allows a logically centralized software program to
  control the behavior of an entire network. &nbsp;</p>
  <p>Separating
  a network's control logic from the underlying physical routers and switches
  that forward traffic allows network operators to write high-level control
  programs that specify the behavior of an entire network, in contrast to
  conventional networks, whereby network operators must codify functionality in
  terms of low-level device configuration. &nbsp;</p>
  <p>Logically
  centralized network control makes it possible for operators to specify more
  complex tasks that involve integrating many disjoint network functions (e.g.,
  security, resource control, prioritization) into a single control framework,
  allowing network operators to create more sophisticated policies, and making
  network configurations easier to configure, manage, troubleshoot, and
  debug.&nbsp;</p>

Title:  Health Policy and the Affordable Care Act
Short desc:  This course will explore the many problems of the American health care system and discuss the specific ways that the Affordable Care Act will impact access, quality, costs, as well as medical innovation.
Long desc:  <p>The American health care system has many problems. 50 million people are uninsured. Quality is extremely uneven, with peaks of greatness at leading academic centers but overall poor quality in both process measures and outcomes such as asthma deaths. Finally, the U.S. health care system spends over $8000 per patient per year, nearly double the next highest country. In March 2010, the Affordable Care Act was enacted. Over the next decade or more, the Act will dramatically re-structure the American health care system.</p>
<p>This course will explore the history and structure of the current American health care system, including the history of and problems with employment-based health insurance, the challenges surrounding access, cost and quality, and the medical malpractice conundrum. The course will then explore the history of health care reform and the challenges that were overcome to achieve health reform in America. Finally, we will delineate the specific ways that the Affordable Care Act improves access and quality, and will control costs. Throughout lessons regarding health economics, health policy, and medical practice will be elucidated.</p>
<p>This class is open to anyone that is interested in gaining a better understanding of the US health care system and the challenges of health care reform. There are no prerequisites or required knowledge of the health system.</p>

Title:  Introduction to Pharmacy
Short desc:  This course is a survey of the profession of pharmacy including its history, evolving scope of practice, ethical foundations, regulation, educational and career opportunities, and more. We will also explore topics relating to medication use and drug development.
Long desc:  <b></b>

<p>Man has always used external materials to help prevent, cure, or alleviate
    the symptoms of disease. In fact, Gregory Higby of the American Institute
    of the History of Pharmacy has written that, “...the very concept
    of influencing bodily functions via an outside force must be considered
    one of humanity’s greatest advances.” Since its independent origins
    in ancient Arabic civilizations, pharmacy has evolved from a craft dedicated
    to the compounding of drugs to a profession focusing on helping patients
    get the best outcomes from medication therapies.</p>
<p>So what is pharmacy? How has it changed and where is it headed?</p>
<p>This course will answer these questions and provide a comprehensive introduction
    to this profession. We will explore the history of pharmacy and its evolving
    scope of practice; examine educational and career pathways; tackle issues
    relating to medication safety and adverse drug events; gain insight into
    the regulatory and ethical considerations in pharmacy practice; and more.</p>
<p>As we explore these topics together, we will hear from practicing pharmacists
    throughout the course and ultimately gain a better understanding of what
    they do and how they help us get the best results from our medications.
    Maybe you will decide that the dynamic profession of pharmacy is a career
    path that you want to pursue!  Whether student or healthcare consumer,
    you’re sure to find the material we cover in this course to be invaluable.</p>

Title:  Listening to World Music
Short desc:  Learn the ideas and vocabulary for listening to world music, and examine the music of several world music cultures and how they have entered into mainstream popular culture.
Long desc:  With the click of a mouse, now more than ever we are able to access sounds made by people from all around the world. And yet, most of us don't listen to the wide diversity of music available to us, probably because it sounds so strange. This class will open up the world of music to you. We begin with a brief history of recording technology, the music industry and the place of world music in that narrative; you are introduced to keywords for talking about music cross-culturally; and then proceed to half a dozen musical cultures around the world. In each of these musical cultures, we examine the ways in which music works in those distant cultures, how it sounds, what it means, who may perform it; and then we ask ourselves where this music has traveled and entered into the Western popular culture as entertainment, political discourse, or artistic purpose.

Title:  Generation Rx: The Science Behind Prescription Drug Abuse
Short desc:  Think that a prescription medication must be safer than a “street drug”? Think again. Investigate the epidemic rise of prescription drug abuse and use science to debunk commonly held misconceptions regarding this phenomenon.
Long desc:  <span>We are Generation Rx. <br><br>As a society, we have become more and more “pharmaceuticalized”. We expect a quick fix for almost any medical problem. We refer to ample amounts of medical information (or mis-information) online, sometimes without the guidance of a health professional. We are taking prescription and over-the-counter medications at unprecedented rates, and there are benefits to this phenomenon, including in many cases, improved disease treatment. Sadly, a darker consequence has also emerged: the epidemic rise of injuries and fatalities due to prescription drug abuse. <br><br>This course uses science to investigate the prevalence, dangers, and misperceptions regarding this growing health problem. Using a myth-busting design, we will investigate the biology behind both therapeutic and illicit drug action and tie that biology to the real dangers of abusing prescription drugs. Additionally, we will explore societal influences on drug-taking behaviors and identify best medication-taking practices for our benefit as well as others’.</span>

</p><p>
















</p><p>Did you grow up in a world without red ribbons, AZT, the
AIDS Memorial Quilt, or Project Red? If you did, chances are good that you came
of age before 1981 and are a member of the last generation of humans on this
planet to be able to say that you remember those ‘carefree days when all you
had to worry about was getting pregnant, herpes, and a bad reputation’ (<a href="http://ihm.nlm.nih.gov/luna/servlet/detail/NLMNLM~1~1~101438751~152104:Return-to-those-carefree-days-when-">AID
Atlanta</a>).</p>

<p>On June 5, 1981 the CDC released a <i>Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report</i> describing the <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/june_5.htm">first five cases</a>
of what later became known as the Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome, or AIDS.
On that day human history broke into two generations: Those who can remember a time before&nbsp;the AIDS pandemic and those who can't.</p>

<p>No matter what generation you grew up in, what we all have
in common is a curiosity about AIDS.&nbsp; Where
did it come from? Why is it so widespread?&nbsp;&nbsp;Are we making progress towards
a vaccine? What is it like to be part of a vaccine trial? Has anyone ever been cured of HIV infection?&nbsp;Are some people just
naturally more or less&nbsp;susceptible to HIV than other people
are?</p>

<p>All of this and more will be covered in <i>AIDS. </i>Over the course of nine weeks we will discuss a wide range of
issues, innovations, and controversies regarding HIV/AIDS in the US and around
the world including everything from what circumcision and Truvada have in
common; how school children in Africa are changing the way AIDS education is
done; where you can go online to learn how many cases of AIDS there are in your
area; and how one man’s insistence that AIDS doesn't exist&nbsp;left hundreds of thousands of people&nbsp;without access to life saving drugs.</p>

Title:  Network Analysis in Systems Biology
Short desc:  An introduction to network analysis and statistical methods used in contemporary Systems Biology and Systems Pharmacology research. 
Long desc:  <p>The
course Network Analysis in Systems Biology provides an introduction to network
analysis and statistical methods used in contemporary Systems Biology and Systems Pharmacology research. Students will learn how to construct, analyze and
visualize different types of molecular networks, including gene regulatory
networks connecting transcription factors to their target genes,
protein-protein interaction networks, cell signaling pathways and networks, drug-target and drug-drug similarity networks and other functional association networks. Methods to process raw data from genome-wide
RNA (microarrays and RNA-seq) and proteomics (IP-MS and phosphoproteomics)
profiling will be presented. Processed data will be clustered, and gene-set
enrichment analyses methods will be covered. The course will also discuss
topics in network systems pharmacology including processing and integrating databases
of drug-target interactions, drug structure, drug/adverse-events, and drug
induced gene expression signatures.   </p>

<span>Half of the course will be devoted to describing major data resources and how these can be processed into networks, bi-partite graphs and gene set libraries for data reuse and integration. Special consideration will be made for the concept of research focus biases and experimental biases. The other half of the course will be devoted to analyses, including unsupervised clustering, data visualization techniques,
network topological properties, and gene-set enrichment analyses. The
course will be useful for students who encounter large datasets in their own
research, typically genome-wide. The course will teach the students how to use existing
software tools such as those developed by the <a href="http://www.mssm.edu/research/labs/maayan-laboratory">Ma’ayan Laboratory</a> at Mount
Sinai, but also other freely available tools. In addition the course
requires the students to write short scripts in Python and participate in </span>crowdsourcing micro-  and mega-task projects. The ultimate aim of the course is to enable students to utilize the data resources and methods they learn here for analyzing their own data for their own projects.<br>

Title:  Introduction to Systems Biology
Short desc:  An introduction to current concepts of how cellular molecules come together to form systems, how these systems exhibit emergent properties, and how these properties are used to make cellular decisions.
Long desc:  <p>This
course will introduce the student to contemporary Systems Biology focused on
mammalian cells, their constituents and their functions. Biology is moving from molecular to modular.
As our knowledge of our genome and gene expression deepens and we develop lists
of molecules (proteins, lipids, ions) involved in cellular processes, we need
to understand how these molecules interact with each other to form modules that
act as discrete functional systems. These systems underlie core subcellular processes such as signal
transduction, transcription, motility and electrical excitability. In turn
these processes come together to exhibit cellular behaviors such as secretion,
proliferation and action potentials. What are the properties of such subcellular
and cellular systems? What are the
mechanisms by which emergent behaviors of systems arise? What types of experiments inform systems-level
thinking? Why do we need computation and simulations to understand these
systems?</p>

<p>The course will develop multiple lines of
reasoning to answer the questions listed above. Two major reasoning threads
are: the design, execution and interpretation of multivariable experiments that
produce large data sets; quantitative reasoning, models and simulations. Examples will be discussed to demonstrate
“how” cell- level functions arise and “why” mechanistic knowledge allows us to
predict cellular behaviors leading to disease states and drug responses.<br></p>

Title:  Dynamical Modeling Methods for Systems Biology
Short desc:  An introduction to dynamical modeling techniques used in contemporary Systems Biology research.
Long desc:  <p>We
take a case-based approach to teach contemporary mathematical modeling
techniques. The course is appropriate
for advanced undergraduates and beginning graduate students. Lectures provide biological background and
describe the development of both classical mathematical models and more recent
representations of biological processes. The course will be useful for students who plan to use experimental
techniques as their approach in the laboratory and employ computational modeling
as a tool to draw deeper understanding of experiments. The course should also
be valuable as an introductory overview for students planning to conduct
original research in modeling biological systems.</p>



This course focuses on
dynamical modeling techniques used in Systems Biology research.  These techniques are based on biological
mechanisms, and simulations with these models generate predictions that can
subsequently be tested experimentally. These testable predictions frequently
provide novel insight into biological processes. The approaches taught here can be grouped
into the following categories: 1)
ordinary differential equation-based models, 2) partial differential
equation-based models, and 3) stochastic models.  <br>

Long desc:  <p>This course analyzes the
historical origins of citizenship and immigration in the United States and provides
an overview of modern U.S. law.  Beyond
traditional notions of “law,” the course also includes significant elements of
immigration policy, social science, history, political theory, and ethics.  One goal of the course is to provide a basic
knowledge base for students to make and influence law and policy in immigration
and citizenship.</p>

<p>Among the questions the
course will explore:</p>

<ul><li>How is U.S. citizenship
acquired?  Can it be lost?</li><li>What is the
origin and significance of the U.S. practice of awarding citizenship to anyone
born here?</li><li>Who decides who
can enter the country, and who must leave?</li><li>What rights do
non-citizens have?  What about those who
have entered the country illegally?</li><li>What is most needed
for immigration reform in the US?</li></ul>

broader issues such as political and cultural values and methods of historical
interpretation.
<br>Some of the topics we will cover include: relations between the Greeks
and their neighbors to the East; Homer and the heroic ideal; the development
of the type of community called the "polis"; the diffusion of Greek civilization
from Southern Italy to the shores of the Black Sea; gods and mortals in
myth, religion and ritual; the roles of women; Athenian drama; the treatment
of slaves and foreigners; and the birth and evolution of democracy. We
will strive to get as full an understanding as we can of this extraordinary,
and extraordinarily influential, society.

<br>Almost all the reading assignments are from ancient sources in translation.
No previous knowledge of ancient history is assumed.

Title:  Property and Liability: An Introduction to Law and Economics
Short desc:  Think about the oldest and most familiar principles of American law, property and proportional liability, in a new and surprising way, and learn to apply economic reasoning to an especially important and interesting aspect of life. 
Long desc:  One of the most interesting
and important developments in social science since 1970 has been the
"discovery" of a consistent economic logic underlying the great
common law subjects of property, contract, tort and crime, the
thousand-year-old bedrock of the English and American legal systems. Property
and contract provide the institutional
scaffolding that makes free exchange in markets possible, while the liability
systems of tort and crime appear to mimic market exchange in areas of human activity
where free exchange itself, for well-defined reasons, is not possible. This
course seeks to expose this underlying economic logic through the close
investigation of a series of paradigmatic problems and examples in light of
some simple but very powerful economic ideas. The course assumes no prior
background in economics or law, and begins with an introduction to the basic
concepts of property, exchange, efficiency and externality. On this foundation,
specific topics in the law, including property, tort and crime, eminent domain, intellectual property and criminal procedure, are considered. Each group of lectures will
elaborate on a different concrete problem or example to suggest the range of legal issues and questions to which economic reasoning can be productively applied. The ideas and
modes of analysis developed in the course are not difficult or mysterious, but
the questions of interpretation and policy that they raise about a subject that affects everyone are challenging and
provocative. <p></p>

Title:  The Modern and the Postmodern
Short desc:  This course examines how the idea of "the modern" develops at the end of the 18th century in European philosophy and literature, and how being modern (or progressive, or hip) became one of the crucial criteria for understanding and evaluating cultural change. Are we still in modernity, or have we moved beyond the modern to the postmodern?
Long desc:  <b></b>In this
course we shall examine how the idea of "the modern" develops at the
end of the 18th century in European intellectual history, and how being modern (or progressive, or hip) became
one of the crucial criteria for understanding and evaluating cultural change
during the last two hundred years in the West. We shall be concerned with the relations
between culture and historical change, and our materials shall be drawn from a
variety of areas: philosophy, the novel, and critical theory. Finally, we shall try to
determine what it means to be modern today, and whether it makes sense to go
beyond the modern to the postmodern.



<p><i>The Modern and the Postmodern</i> traces the intertwining of the
idea of modernity with the idea of art or culture from the late 18th
century until the present. Beginning with the Enlightenment, Western cultures
have invested heavily in the notion that the world can be made more of a home
for human beings through the development of culture (and technology).
Throughout this period there has also developed a strong, sophisticated
counter-movement that sees the Enlightenment effort as a disaster – destructive
of both art and of the world.</p>



<p>The
Western idea of modernity is linked to but not the same as the idea of
modernism. We will examine both in this class and then consider postmodernism
in relation both to the philosophical idea of modernity and to the aesthetic
considerations of modernism.</p>



This course covers a lot of ground,
historically, conceptually and aesthetically. There is much to read, and very
different kinds of reading: from philosophy to novels, from theory to poetry.
Not all students will like all the reading, but if you digest it all, you
should have a clearer sense of the cultural history of our present. 



<br><br>Students
should develop a historical, literary and philosophical understanding of some
of the key themes of modernity and modernism in the West. They should learn to
read classic and contemporary texts for their arguments, beauty and pertinence.
They should see why these texts are “good to think with,” and, it is hoped,
they will develop an appetite for further study in the areas covered by the
course.

Title:  Principles of Public Health
Short desc:  Principles of Public Health introduces the major concepts and principles of public health and the determinants of health status in communities. Emphasizes the ecological model that focuses on the linkages and relationships among multiple natural and social determinants affecting health.
Long desc:  <p>Principles of Public Health&nbsp;introduces the major concepts of public health and the
determinants of health status in communities. The course emphasizes the
ecological model that focuses on the linkages and relationships among multiple
natural and social determinants affecting health. As a relative concept, the
health of populations is assessed through comparisons of temporal, spatial, and
demographic dimensions of disease burden. The goal of public health is to
understand why and how different populations carry different kinds and amounts
of disease burden, and to use that knowledge for improving health by preventing
disease.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Students in the course will explore successful examples in
public health, including how scientific discoveries and regulatory policies
have both contributed to mitigate risk factors and improve health outcomes. How
socioeconomic and cultural factors modify the effectiveness of risk
intervention and disease prevention strategies. How individual actions and
collective initiatives play important roles in determining the status of
health. In addition, how the various methodological approaches that guide
discoveries in public health have been applied from the local scale to the
global level.</p>

Title:  Generating the Wealth of Nations
Short desc:  A survey of the history of economic development in the world in the past 300 years.
Long desc:  <p>If
you had been alive at the start of the eighteenth century, your material
well-being would have been much the same whichever region of the world you
lived in, and it would almost certainly have been a precarious existence.  Go back 300 years before the eighteenth
century, and not much was different.  But
come forward 300 years to the present, and we see a startling transformation. </p>

<p>Incomes
in some parts of the world have increased more than ten-fold; and now it most
certainly does matter where you live – with income differentials of 50 times
between the world’s richest and poorest countries.  What has changed in the past 300 years is the
development and application of new technologies at a pace unprecedented in
human history – the steam engine, electricity and the computer, to name just a
few.  With these developments, for those
who have access to them, have come huge gains in living standards.</p>

<p>In
this course we’ll explore the spectacular (but uneven) story of economic
development – beginning with the Malthusian era, moving on to the take-off of
growth in the Industrial Revolution and the Great Divergence in living
standards that followed, and finishing in the present with the Global Financial
Crisis.  We’ll cover the main episodes
and events in the development of the world economy in the past 300 years, and
have something to say about most regions of the world.  As well as dealing with ‘what happened’, the
course will emphasise what is known about ‘why’ – and what lessons historical
experience can provide for understanding how some countries today are so rich
yet others remain so poor.</p><p>Course image: Copyright JL Brown. Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported (CC BY 3.0) <br></p><br>

Title:  Climate Change
Short desc:  This course develops an interdisciplinary understanding of the social, political, economic and scientific perspectives on climate change.
Long desc:  <p></p><p><b></b>What is Climate Change? How should we respond to
Climate Change? These questions are complex, not least because the responses
available to us depend upon who is providing the answers and the particular
perspective they take. The economist sees the economic challenges and
opportunities of Climate Change; the scientist sees the need to describe and
explain Climate Change; the policy-maker and social scientist
see Climate Change as a social problem. Therefore, the first step to
understanding Climate Change and what we do about it is to see how experts from
different disciplines engage with the issue. The second step is to appreciate how
our response to Climate Change depends upon the interplay between these
different approaches.</p>

<p>This course offers you an introduction to different
disciplinary perspectives on Climate Change to help you think about how Climate Change
affects you as an individual, as a member of your local community, as a citizen
of your country and as a member of the global community. We have designed the
presentations, discussions, activities and assessment tasks in this course to
help you understand what Climate Change is and what you – and we – should do about it.</p>

Title:  Epigenetic Control of Gene Expression
Short desc:  Each mammalian cell has the same genes, yet performs distinct functions. This is achieved by epigenetic control of gene expression; the switching on and switching off of genes. This course will cover the principles of epigenetic control of gene expression, how epigenetic control contributes to cellular differentiation and development, and how it goes wrong in disease.
Long desc:  <p><b></b>While the human genome sequence has
transformed our understanding of human biology, it isn’t just the sequence of
your DNA that matters, but also how you use it! How are some genes activated
and others are silenced? How is this controlled? The answer is epigenetics.  </p>

<p>Epigenetics has been a hot topic for research
over the past decade as it has become clear that aberrant epigenetic control
contributes to disease (particularly to cancer). Epigenetic alterations are heritable
through cell division, and in some instances are able to behave similarly to
mutations in terms of their stability. Importantly, unlike genetic mutations,
epigenetic modifications are reversible and therefore have the potential to be
manipulated therapeutically. It has also become clear in recent years that
epigenetic modifications are sensitive to the environment (for example diet),
which has sparked a large amount of public debate and research.</p>

<p>This course will give an introduction to the
fundamentals of epigenetic control. We will examine epigenetic phenomena that
are manifestations of epigenetic control in several organisms, with a focus on
mammals. We will examine the interplay between epigenetic control and the
environment and finally the role of aberrant epigenetic control in disease.</p>

Long desc:  <p>Many of us derive inspiration from watching natural history
documentaries and their astounding catalogue of wild animal behaviours.  In this course, we will explore how
scientists study animal behaviour, and in particular how behaviour is shaped by the evolutionary forces of natural and sexual
selection. Topics include resource acquisition; avoiding enemies; mate choice and sexual conflict; cues, signals and communication; parental care and social behaviour; and
the role of genes, environments and learning in regulating behavioural diversity.  We
draw on examples from across the animal kingdom to illustrate the complex
mechanisms underlying adaptations, and complement these with natural
history videos that highlight key concepts. We evaluate the scientific rigour
of studies used to test theory, and highlight the often ingenious methods
adopted by researchers to understand animal behaviour.</p>

Title:  Principles of Macroeconomics
Short desc:   All of us are affected by macroeconomic forces – they shape the very world we live in. And governments all around the world try to shape those forces in ways that (hopefully) improve the lives of their constituents. In this subject, we will examine the major theories used by macro economists to analyse national economies and the international economy. 
Long desc:  <p>In this course,
we will examine the main bodies of economic theory that have been used to guide
economists’ and policy makers’ understanding of the macroeconomy. Macroeconomics
is a word derived from the Greek prefix “makros”, meaning large. It is the study
of economic aggregates, of national and international economies and of the
economic management role played by governments and international organisations.
</p>

<p>The founder of
modern macroeconomics, the British economist John Maynard Keynes, famously wrote
“The ideas of economists and political philosophers, both when they are right
and when they are wrong are more powerful than is commonly understood. Indeed,
the world is ruled by little else. Practical men, who believe themselves to be
quite exempt from any intellectual influences, are usually slaves of some
defunct economist.” This will be the key theme we explore in the course, the
influence of theory and the way that policy responses to events like recession,
unemployment, inflation and the Global Financial Crisis, reflect that theory.</p>

<p>We will cover
important macroeconomic concepts such as the national accounts, unemployment
and inflation, explain how the ideas associated with John Maynard Keynes laid
the foundation for governments’ active management of the macroeconomy in the
post war era, and examine the intellectual basis for the monetary and fiscal
policy responses to the Global Financial Crisis.&nbsp; Economists’ approaches to the analysis of
long run economic growth will also be considered. The approach will be
critical. There are few areas of human endeavour that attract so much debate
and disagreement as the management of a modern industrial economy. We will not
shy away from those debates. But what we will do is emphasise the systematic
theorising that underlies the way macroeconomists and policy makers approach
their task. The aim is to enable those who take the course to become informed
analysts of the macroeconomy and of current (and past) macroeconomic policy
debates.</p><p><i>Image source: Nilss Olekalns University of Melbourne 2012</i><br></p>

Title:  Jazz Improvisation
Short desc:  Learn the basic concepts of improvisation from Gary Burton, one of the most renowned improvisers in the jazz world, including the mental, melodic, and harmonic processes that contribute to the instinctive skills that an improviser puts to use when taking a solo.
Long desc:  While many people are fans of
jazz and understand that musicians are often “making up” the
notes they are playing during a performance, most people—often
including musicians, themselves, who are beginning to learn improvising—aren’t
clear about what exact processes take place to enable this to happen. The
purpose of this course is to introduce the basic concepts of modern improvisation and
how to go about mastering the different musical and mental skills involved. <br><br>Course author Gary Burton codifies a sought-after approach to improvisation that has been at the 
core of Berklee College of Music's curriculum for decades. Students who complete
this course will know what to practice and how to practice the
various aspects of improvising, in addition to understanding how the improviser spontaneously
communicates to the listeners through their musical creations.

Title:  Accountable Talk®: Conversation that Works
Short desc:  Designed for teachers and learners in every setting - in school and out, in formal learning environments or at home - this course is an introduction to the theory and practice of well-structured talk that builds the mind.
Long desc:  Designed for teachers and learners in every setting - in school and out,
in formal learning environments or at home - Introduction to <i>Accountable Talk </i>is
an introduction to the theory and practice of well-structured talk that
builds the mind. You will learn from the growing body of research and from
educators who put it into practice, why intentionally structured talk promotes
learning and how educators can design talk situations that promote learning.
The course includes video examples of children and adults engaging in <i>Accountable Talk</i> in
a variety of settings and will enable you to begin to build <i>Accountable Talk</i> in
your own learning community. While the <i>Accountable Talk</i> program was
originally developed for K-12 classrooms, its structures and practices
are readily and productively applicable to any situation in which people
get together and talk in order to learn. The course was developed by the
School of Education and the Institute for Learning at the University of
Pittsburgh. The Institute for Learning was founded by Lauren Resnick, an
internationally renowned cognitive psychologist, in 1995. Since then, under
Resnick’s leadership, the Institute for Learning has worked to support the
improvement of education and achievement of all students in more than 70
school districts in 23 different states.

Title:  Clinical Terminology for International and U.S. Students
Short desc:  Understanding the clinical terms and abbreviations commonly used in U.S. hospitals is challenging. Adaptation to clinical language is difficult for U.S. students entering the clinical area and even more difficult for international students whose primary language is not English. This course helps both groups of students understand many of the terms and abbreviations commonly encountered during the first three months of clinical work on a U.S. general hospital unit.
Long desc:  <p>The language of health care providers at U.S. clinical sites is heavily infused with abbreviations and technical terms. Frequently, there is little time to ask for explanations. This course focuses on terms and abbreviations that will be heard or seen
    during early clinical work. Terms are presented according to the clinical context in which they will be experienced using print, audio and visual representations. A web-based clinical dictionary for beginners provides additional information about
    terms presented in the course as well as definitions of many important terms that could not be covered in the six week course.</p>

Title:  Disaster Preparedness
Short desc:  During this course, students will gain an understanding of the Disaster Cycle, concentrating on the Mitigation Phase. They will examine disaster planning on a personal level developing a disaster plan and examine Awareness and Attitude during disasters and daily life.
Long desc:  This course will teach the student how to survive when everything we normally
take for granted is gone, when the structures we depend on have failed.
We will examine the Disaster Cycle, particularly the Mitigation and Recovery
phases. Students will prepare an extensive personal preparedness plan covering
such topics as supplies, communication, food and water, shelter, security,
and comfort (yes even in survival there can and should be comfort). We
also look at preparedness on the institutional and government levels.
<br>
<br>We will look beyond these plans towards the one aspect of survival, which
will enable a person to survive when all planning has failed. Disasters,
by definition, overwhelm all available resources. If all available resources
are gone, only one thing will keep a person alive and that is their attitude.
A persons awareness and attitude, the two are closely linked, allow a person
the means to remain calm, avoid panic, and draw upon resources within and
outside the person to survive when their world has failed. In truth not
everyone survives in extreme circumstances; people die, but, even in death,
attitude, if it cannot save you, provides some degree or comfort.

Title:  Nutrition and Physical Activity for Health
Short desc:  This course will provide a coherent, understandable look at the evidence on how nutrition and physical activity impact health through lower morbidity, longevity, and quality of life.
Long desc:  Over 65 percent of adults and over 30 percent of children meet the classification
of being overweight or obese, and with this excess weight comes numerous
health conditions that include heart disease, diabetes, cancer, musculoskeletal
disorders, and even impairments in cognitive function. Because in most
cases the core cause of obesity and its related health conditions is a
poor quality of diet and lack of sufficient physical activity, it is no
surprise that to reverse this health problem a foundation of proper nutrition
and sufficient physical activity is imperative.
<br>
<br>This course is designed to provide a foundation of nutritional knowledge
to develop a sustainable pattern of healthy eating. To this will be added
a foundation of knowledge related to physical activity and exercise. These
two key lifestyle behaviors are then brought together under the umbrella
of calorie balance, which is the understanding of how we balance the calories
that we eat in our diet with the calories that we burn to sustain life
and to perform all of our daily tasks and functions.
<br>
<br>Ultimately, this information can only be of value if individuals understand
how to engage in these healthy behaviors within their daily lives when
they are faced with challenges and barriers. This course will address key
issues and will provide information on effective strategies for adopting
and maintaining these targeted behaviors as they apply to the adoption
and maintenance of a healthy lifestyle.

Title:  Climate Literacy: Navigating Climate Change Conversations
Short desc:  Climate Literacy tackles the scientific and socio-political dimensions of climate change. This course introduces the basics of the climate system, models and predictions, human and natural impacts, mitigative and adaptive responses, and the evolution of climate policy.
Long desc:  <p>This course explores the basic concepts and terms needed to understand
    the science of climate change, and the available mitigation, adaptation
    and policy options. By the end of the course, students will be able to:</p>
<p>·&nbsp; Tell the story of our climate, describing how interactions among
    atmosphere, ocean, land, and life lead to climatic changes at all timescales</p>
<p>·&nbsp; Evaluate the likely effect of historical human fossil emissions
    and land use changes on Earth’s energy balance and climate.</p>
<p>·&nbsp; Describe the direct observations of climate change in recent decades, and articulate the evidence attributing global
    warming in this time period to human causes.</p>
<p>·&nbsp; Assess the utility - and limits - of climate models to predict
    global and regional climate change.</p>
<p>·&nbsp; Articulate the demographic, economic, technological and political
    factors that influence both humans’ impact on the climate and humans’ vulnerability
    to climate change.</p>
<p>·&nbsp; Express an informed opinion on the scope and urgency of the efforts
    needed to both mitigate and adapt to climate change.</p>
<p>&nbsp;We provide the scientific basics of climate change paired with the
    response options (mitigation and adaptation) and policy landscape. Focusing
    exclusively on the science of climate change may not allow a nuanced understanding
    of the social implications of this science.&nbsp; Similarly, political
    or economic analyses of climate change frequently neglect the underlying
    mechanics behind climate change thresholds, feedbacks, and the potential
    for abrupt change. This course explores linkages between climate change
    and other pressing priorities such as human health, poverty, community
    livability, economic resilience, and other environmental problems (such
    as biodiversity and water quality).&nbsp; We acknowledge the urgent need
    to design innovative strategies that realize multiple objectives (or co-benefits)
    simultaneously, and explore the particular capacity for sustainability

Title:  Malicious Software and its Underground Economy: Two Sides to Every Story
Short desc:  Learn about traditional and mobile malware, the security threats they represent, state-of-the-art analysis and detection techniques, and the underground ecosystem that drives such a profitable but illegal business.
Long desc:  Cybercrime has become both more widespread and harder to battle. Researchers and anecdotal
experience show that the cybercrime scene is becoming increasingly organized
and consolidated, with strong links also to traditional criminal networks.
Modern attacks are indeed stealthy and often profit oriented.

<br><br>Malicious software (malware) is the traditional way in which cybercriminals infect user
and enterprise hosts to gain access to their private, financial, and
intellectual property data. Once stolen, such information can enable more
sophisticated attacks, generate illegal revenue, and allow for cyber-espionage.
<br><br>By mixing a practical, hands-on approach with the theory and techniques behind the scene, the course discusses the current academic and underground research in the
field, trying to answer the foremost question about malware and underground
economy, namely, "Should we care?".<br><br> Students will learn how traditional and mobile malware work, how they are analyzed and
detected, peering through the underground ecosystem that drives this profitable
but illegal business.

Understanding how malware operates is of paramount importance to form knowledgeable experts, teachers, researchers, and practitioners able to fight back.  Besides, it allows us to gather intimate knowledge of the systems and the threats, which is a necessary step to successfully devise novel, effective, and practical mitigation techniques.

Title:  Introduction to Systematic Program Design - Part 1
Short desc:  This course is about learning to program well: building programs that are elegant, well tested and easy to maintain.  The course is designed for students with no programming experience at all. Nonetheless, former students who already knew how to program have said it made them better programmers.
Long desc:  <p>Phones, diesel engines, animated newspapers, medical devices, games, political
    campaigns, medical research, mining, transportation systems, ... and so
    on, and on, and on... every day more of the world around us is at least
    partly run by computer programs. This means that being able to design programs
    - or at least be able to work with people who design programs - is becoming
    a more and more valuable skill.</p>
<p>To build your own programs you need to know two things: how to use the
    specific programming language and libraries needed, and the more general
    skill of how to design a program.</p>
<p>This course presents a <b>design method</b> that will enable you to approach
    the design of complex programs systematically. The method will work for
    programs in this course as well as hard to design programs you develop
    in the future.</p>
<p>Using this method you will learn how to model the information in a problem
    domain, how to structure program data to mirror that information and how
    to further structure the data to lead to a well organized program. You
    will also learn to distinguish those parts of a program that are naturally
    data driven, from those that should use an alternative algorithmic approach.
    The method uses unit-tests to both produce a better developed design, and
    to test your program as you develop it.</p>
<p>In the first course -- Part 1 -- we use a simple
    teaching language to cover the core of the design method. In Part 1 we cover various forms of data; simple interactive programs like games and animations; storing information in and rendering trees; and finally exploring search programs: programs that solve puzzles like Sudoku boards.&nbsp;</p><p>A second phase of the course, to be offered later, &nbsp;will consist of parallel tracks, with each track using a different popular
    programming language and focusing on a different kind of problem. This
    will help you bring the design method to whatever language and problem
    domain interests you.<br></p>

Title:  Linear and Discrete Optimization
Short desc:  The course is an introduction to linear and discrete optimization - an important part of computational mathematics with a wide range of applications in many areas of everyday life.
Long desc:  This
 course serves as an introduction to linear and discrete 
optimization from the viewpoint of a mathematician or computer 
scientist.  Besides learning how linear and discrete optimization can be applied, we focus on 
understanding methods that solve linear programs and discrete optimization problems in a mathematically 
rigorous way. <br><br>We will answer  questions like:<br><br><ul><li>Does a particular method work correctly?</li><li>Does it terminate and, if yes, in what time?</li><li>Can we prove that a solution is optimal?</li></ul>The
 course starts by discussing what a linear program is and how linear programming can be 
applied. Then, we will treat the simplex method and the theory of 
duality. We will then discuss some combinatorial optimization problems like maximum weight bipartite matching and maximum flows. <br><br>The
 course constitutes about half of the material on linear and discrete optimization 
that is taught for mathematics and computer science undergraduates at 
EPFL and will feature video lectures, quizzes, programming assignments, 
and a final exam. <br>

Title:  Archaeology's Dirty Little Secrets
Short desc:  Admit it — you wanted to be an archaeologist when you grew up...  This course builds on that enthusiasm, while radically expanding your notions about just what archaeology is and just what archaeologists do. 
Long desc:  <p>
















</p><p>
















</p><p>In this class, we will ask and answer a series of questions
about the role and practice of archaeology in the world today. If archaeologists
are trained to investigate the past, what is left for us to study?&nbsp; Who gets to be an archaeologist?&nbsp; How and why do archaeologists hunt for
“treasures”, and what do we do once we’ve discovered them?&nbsp; What can we know, and not know, about people
in the past? &nbsp;What do archaeologists know
about the past that most people would never guess – and why aren’t we telling
you?&nbsp; Why are people entirely willing to
murder each other over the fate of archaeological sites? &nbsp;Are Real Men alone capable of discovering the
truth behind all this?</p>

Archaeology famously involves getting dirty in
the line of duty.&nbsp; Students will
experience its hands-on nature, through the use of numerous exercises and archaeological
case studies.&nbsp; But there are other ‘dirty
little secrets’ to learn about the field: not least how the stories
archaeologists tell about the past have been used and abused, for purposes both
good and bad.&nbsp; Our goal by the end of the
course is to have you ‘thinking like an archaeologist’ and fully aware of the often-fraught
politics of doing archaeology around the globe.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br><p></p>

Title:  Coding the Matrix: Linear Algebra through Computer Science Applications
Short desc:  Learn the concepts and methods of linear algebra, and how to use them to think about computational problems arising in computer science.  Coursework includes building on the concepts to write small programs and run them on real data. 
Long desc:  <div>When you take a digital photo with your phone or transform the image in Photoshop, when you play a video game or watch a movie with digital effects, when you do a web search or make a phone call, you are using technologies that build upon linear algebra.  Linear algebra provides concepts that are crucial to many areas of computer science, including graphics, image processing, cryptography, machine learning, computer vision, optimization, graph algorithms, quantum computation, computational biology, information retrieval and web search. Linear algebra in turn is built on two basic elements, the matrix and the vector.  </div><div><br></div><div>In this class, you will learn the concepts and methods of  linear algebra, and how to use them to think about problems arising in computer science.  You will write small programs in the programming language Python to  implement basic matrix and vector functionality and algorithms, and use these to process real-world data to achieve such tasks as: two-dimensional graphics transformations, face morphing, face detection, image transformations such as blurring and edge detection, image perspective removal, audio and image compression, searching within an image or an audio clip, classification of tumors as malignant or  benign, integer factorization, error-correcting codes, secret-sharing, network layout, document classification, and computing Pagerank (Google's ranking method).</div><div><br></div>

Title:  The Fiction of Relationship
Short desc:  What is the nature of our relationship to others and the world?  How can literature help us see these relationships more clearly? This course seeks to explore such questions through adventurous readings of ten great works of narrative fiction from the 18th to the 20th century.
Long desc:  <p>As
individuals we are defined by relationships, by our connection to people,
places, and things. Such connectedness can be not only emotional and erotic but
also political, environmental, and even textual, enacted through writing. In
this course we explore the nature and meaning of such connections in ten&nbsp;major works of narrative fiction from the 18th century to the
present. These include: <i>Manon Lescaut</i> by Abbé Prévost; two works by Herman Melville, <i>Bartleby the Scrivener </i>and <i>Benito Cereno</i>; Charlotte Brontë’s <i>Jane Eyre</i> and two stories by Franz
Kafka, “Metamorphosis” and “The Country Doctor”;
Virginia Woolf’s <i>To the Lighthouse</i>
and William Faulkner’s <i>Light in August</i>;&nbsp; an anthology of stories, <i>Ficciones</i>, by Jorge Luis
Borges and <i>The Ice Palace </i>by Tarjei
Vesaas; Tony Morrison’s <i>Beloved</i> and <i>Disgrace</i> by J.M. Coetzee.</p>
















<p>As this course will demonstrate, the most
critical relationships in our lives—the comings and goings that define us—are
not always easy to get a fix on, but literature offers us a special sighting on
these arrangements. Through exploratory readings of these narrative works, the
course will seek to make relationship visible, bringing our traffic with the
world and with others into clearer focus.</p>

Title:  Songwriting
Short desc:  Learn an efficient, effective process for writing songs that express your ideas and emotions, including a range of tools that revolve around the concept of prosody—the matching of lyrics and music to support your underlying message. 
Long desc:  There’s a songwriter lurking somewhere inside you, peeking
around corners, wondering if it’s safe to come out. Now it is. This course is an
invitation to let your inner songwriter step into the sunlight. All it takes is
a simple “yes” and you’ll be climbing that windy hill, marveling at the view.<br><br>If you haven’t written any or many songs, this course will show you
an efficient, effective process for tailoring songs to express your ideas and
emotions. If you have, you’ll look at your process differently, taking control
of aspects of the process you may have not noticed.<br><br>The course will start by examining the tools available to you, all
revolving around the essential concept of <i>prosody</i>. You’ll learn to use your
tools to enhance your message—to work compositionally at the same time you’re
developing your ideas.<br><br>You’ll be working both lyrically and musically, though
musically it’s not necessary that you either read music or play an instrument.
If you play, great, and you’ll be encouraged to play and record your musical
responses to the assignments. If you don’t play, the course offers you a number
of musical loops to work with. All you’ll have to do is sing your melodies over
the loops.<br><br>Assignments will ask you to post something for peer review—sometimes lyric lines or sections, sometimes
melodies, sometimes both. None of it has to be polished. The course is about writing,
not performing.<br><br>Most important, you’ll have a lot of fun.

Title:  Introduction to Music Production
Short desc:  Learn about the music production process—including recording, editing, and mixing—and the tools available to you to create contemporary music on your computer. 
Long desc:  With the recent introduction of high-quality-low-cost software and hardware, the tools of music production are now available to the masses. Albums are made in bedrooms as well as studios. On the surface this is liberating. Anyone can make an album for the low cost of a couple pieces of gear and a software package. But, if you dig deeper, you will find that it is not so easy. Producing music requires knowledge, <b></b>dedication, and creativity.<br>    <br>Knowledge is where this course comes in. No matter what kind of music you are making, there is a large set of tools that you will need to use.  Each lesson of this course will demonstrate a different set of music production tools, loosely following along the music production process of recording, editing, and mixing. <br><br>We will start with some background on the nature of sound and how we perceive it. We will then examine the components necessary to record audio into a computer, so that you understand the devices that sound must travel through in a music production process. <br>    <br>Once recorded, sound must be organized along a timeline, a process known as editing. It allows us to give the impression of perfect performances and create many of the sounds we hear in contemporary music. The contemporary editing tool is the Digital Audio Workstation (DAW),  a piece of software that stores and organizes all the assets of a musical project. We will focus on the editing tools that are essential in contemporary music production and that all DAWs provide. <br><br>After editing, sounds must be combined or mixed together, so we look to the mixing board—a very creative place if you know how to use it. We will explore the basic functionality of both hardware and software mixing boards, including volume, pan, mute, solo, busses, inserts, sends, and submixes. The mixing process, however, includes more tools than the mixing board provides on its own. Sound must also be processed, modified from its recorded state to fit the context of the music. We will look at compression, equalization, and delay, and examine the many audio effects that are offshoots of these devices and how they are used in a musical context.<br>    <br>We will then explore the synthesizer, a major tool within the production of contemporary music. Yes, great music can and will be created without the synthesizer, but learning how a synthesizer works will give you a language to describe sound. Music is a collaborative art form, so there is nothing more powerful than effective communication. <br>    <br>In the end, the music production process relies on your creativity. Creativity is a product of the mind and will stay there, unexpressed, until the right tools are used in the right way to share it with the world. If you have an idea in your head, it will take numerous steps, each with an important tool, to reach your audience. You bring the dedication and creativity, and this course will bring you the knowledge to make that happen.<br>

Title:  Sports and Society
Short desc:  This course explores the role of sports around the world, and how the games we watch and play shape identity, culture, and society. 
Long desc:  Sports play a giant role in contemporary society worldwide. But
few of us pause to think about the larger questions of money, politics,
race, sex, culture, and commercialization that surround sports everywhere. This course draws on the tools of anthropology, sociology, history,
and other disciplines to give you new perspectives on the games we watch
and play. We will focus on both popular sports like soccer (or “football,”
as anyone outside America calls it), basketball, and baseball, and also
lesser-known ones like mountain-climbing and fishing. Special guests
will include former major league baseball player and ESPN commentator
<a href="http://www.dougglanville.com">Doug Glanville</a>; leading sports journalist <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selena_Roberts">Selena Roberts</a>; best-selling soccer author <a target="_blank" href="http://books.google.com/books/about/The_Ball_is_Round.html?id=_ODMn27ZKG8C">David G</a><a target="_blank" href="http://books.google.com/books/about/The_Ball_is_Round.html?id=_ODMn27ZKG8C">oldblatt</a>; skateboarding expert Dwayne Dixon; and Katya Wesolowski, a specialist in the Afro-Brazilian martial art of capoeira.&nbsp;You will never watch or think
        about sports in the same way again.

Title:  Pattern-Oriented Software Architectures: Programming Mobile Services for Android Handheld Systems
Short desc:  In this course--the second in a trans-institution sequence of MOOCs on Mobile Cloud Computing with Android--we will learn how to apply patterns, pattern languages, and frameworks to alleviate the complexity of developing concurrent and networked services on mobile devices running Android that connect to popular cloud computing platforms. 

Long desc:  <p>The confluence of multi-core and distributed-core processors, inexpensive mass storage, ubiquitous wireless connectivity, and commodity software platforms is driving the need for&nbsp;software engineers and programmers&nbsp;who understand how to develop
    concurrent&nbsp;and networked software for mobile devices that connect to cloud computing platforms. Despite many improvements in processors, storage, and networks, however, developing quality software on-time and on-budget remains hard. Moreover,
    developing high quality <i>reusable
</i> concurrent and&nbsp;networked software apps and services is even harder. &nbsp;The principles, methods, and&nbsp;skills required to develop such software are best learned by&nbsp;attaining mastery of&nbsp;<i>patterns</i>, <i>pattern languages</i>,
    and <i>frameworks</i>.</p>
<p>

    A <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_design_pattern">pattern</a>&nbsp;describes a reusable solution to a common problem that arises within a particular context. When related patterns are woven together they form a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pattern_language">pattern language</a> that
    defines a vocabulary and a process for the orderly resolution of software development problems. A&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_framework">framework</a>&nbsp;is an integrated set of components that collaborate to provide a reusable
    architecture for a family of related apps or services. &nbsp;Frameworks can also be viewed as concrete realizations of pattern languages that facilitate direct reuse of detailed design and source code.</p>
<p>

    This MOOC describes <i>by example</i> how to apply patterns, pattern languages, and frameworks to&nbsp;alleviate the complexity of developing concurrent and networked&nbsp;software for mobile devices via the use of object-oriented design techniques,
    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_(programming_language)" target="_blank">Java</a>programming language features, and&nbsp;<a href="http://developer.android.com/" target="_blank">Android&nbsp;</a>middleware. An extended case study project
    will be used throughout the MOOC to showcase pattern-oriented software design and programming techniques&nbsp;for concurrent and networked mobile devices and clouds.</p>
<p><b>Note: This course is part of a trans-institution sequence of MOOCs entitled <a href="https://www.coursera.org/specialization/mobilecloudcomputing/2">Mobile Cloud Computing with Android</a></b>
</p>
<p>This MOOC and two others, taught by Dr. Adam Porter from the University of Maryland and Dr. Jules White from Vanderbilt University, have been designed to complement each other as part of the first trans-institution sequence of MOOCs taught on the Coursera
    platform, structured as follows:</p>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>The University of Maryland MOOC, <a href="https://www.coursera.org/course/android" target="_blank">Programming Mobile Applications for Android Handheld Systems</a>, will start on January 21st, 2014. It focuses on the design and programming of user-facing
        applications. &nbsp;</li>
    <li>The first Vanderbilt MOOC in the sequence, <a href="http://www.coursera.org/course/posa">Programming Mobile Services for Android Handheld Systems</a>, will start on April 2nd. It focuses on middleware systems programming topics, such as synchronous
        and asynchronous concurrency models, background service processing, structured data management, local inter-process communication and networking, and integration with cloud-based services. &nbsp;</li>
    <li>The second Vanderbilt MOOC in the sequence, <a href="http://www.coursera.org/course/mobilecloud">Programming Cloud Services for Android Handheld Systems</a>, will be start on June 15th, 2014. It focuses on how to connect Android mobile devices to cloud
        computing and data storage resources, essentially turning a device into an extension of powerful cloud-based services on popular cloud computing platforms, such as Google App Engine and Amazon EC2.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p>Some of the programming assignments and the course project for these MOOCs will be coordinated.&nbsp;
    <br>
</p>
<p>If you just want to take some of the MOOCs in this sequence or take them all in different order you’re certainly welcome to do so, and you’ll still learn a lot. However, if you take all the MOOCs in this sequence in the order presented you’ll gain a deeper,
    end-to-end understanding of handheld systems, their applications and services, as well as their integration into the cloud.</p>

Title:  Modern European Mysticism and Psychological Thought
Short desc:  The course will examine the psychological thought of the modern mystical traditions in Europe. We shall focus on two topics with wider cultural implications – the soul and the heart. 

Long desc:  <p>In the revival of mysticism today, mysticism has become more psychological while psychology is increasingly interested in mysticism. This course will provide an entry into the complex world of modern mysticism, through studying its psychological thought. We shall begin with exploring the interpretations of mystical experience offered by psychoanalysts in the twentieth century, starting with Sigmund Freud and Carl Jung and ending with contemporary thinkers such as James Hillman. However, we will see that the European mystical traditions, including Kabbalah in the Jewish world and those of the Catholic, Orthodox and Protestant worlds, developed their own elaborate systems of psychological thought. Thus, we will mostly examine mystical psychology on its own terms. We shall especially look at two terms that are very much in use also in general culture: the heart (as an emotional rather than a physical center!...) and the soul, looking at the unique mystical concepts of their nature and destiny and asking if there were influences and meetings between the different religions.</p>

Title:  Leading Strategic Innovation in Organizations
Short desc:  Improve your ability to manage creativity and to lead an innovation strategy in businesses, schools, hospitals, governments, and other complex organizations and institutions, by diagnosing likely innovation failures before they occur.
Long desc:  <span>This
course is intended to help you improve your ability to manage creativity,
innovation and change in business, education, healthcare, government, and in
any other complex organization or institution by diagnosing potential
innovation failures before they can occur. Using an “<span>innovation constraints<i>”</i></span> framework that draws on modern social
science research and on insights from business practice, participants will
learn how to best manage people (be they co-workers, bosses, customers,
clients, friends or any other stakeholders) when innovation is the goal.&nbsp;
While we see several examples of technological innovation, we are not focused
on the management of technology.&nbsp;
Instead, we focus on something much more powerful:&nbsp; understanding and managing the people engaged
in creation, innovation and positive change, regardless of the context. </span>

<p>The course is
designed to help you answer the following types of questions:</p>

<ul><li>What are the conditions for successful
     innovation?</li><li>What causes innovation to fail?</li><li>What makes creative people creative?</li><li>How should I manage an innovative team?</li><li>How do I lead an effective brainstorm process?</li><li>What is an innovation portfolio and how can
     I manage one?</li><li>Why do so many great ideas get killed?</li></ul>

<p><span>The approach in this
class will be to treat innovation as the process of <i>generating</i>, <i>assessing</i>,
and then <i>implementing</i> useful and valuable ideas.&nbsp; As we will
discuss, generating ideas is relatively easy; what can be hard is getting those
ideas listened to, accepted, and implemented in organizations.&nbsp; In
addition to learning how to lead creative people and creative teams, participants
will also learn techniques for improving their own creativity.&nbsp; During the
course you will engage numerous activities and exercises intended to bring
current habits of thought and behavior to the surface for examination and
change.<br></span></p>

Title:  Synapses, Neurons and Brains 
Short desc:  You will become intimately acquainted with the operational principles of neuronal “life-ware” (synapses, neurons and the networks that they form) as well as with recent ideas about how the dynamics of these networks generate the “neuronal code.”  As an aperitif we will highlight present brain-excitements and for dessert we will discuss the future of brain research

Long desc:  <p></p>
<p>Probably the greatest challenge of the “21st century of the brain” is
    to understand how subcellular and cellular neuronal processes give rise
    to behavior – movement, perception, emotions, memory and creativity. This
    course will discuss, step-by-step, how modern molecular, optical, electrical,
    anatomical and theoretical methods have provided fascinating insights into
    the operation of the elementary building blocks of brains and, most importantly,
    how neuronal mechanisms underlie memory and learning processes. We will
    next discuss why computer simulations are so essential for understanding
    both neuronal “life ware” and the emergence of networks dynamics (e.g.,
    as in the “Blue Brain Project”).&nbsp;</p>
<p>The course will start by highlighting a few recent brain-excitements,
    including treating the sick brain via electrical stimulation, recent attempts
    at “reading the brain code” for brain-machine interfaces, new neuro-anatomical
    techniques (“Brainbow” and connectomics) and physiological methods (optogenetics)
    that enables us to record/activate the living, behaving brain at single
    cell resolution. We will end by discussing emerging frontiers in brain
    research, including the interaction between brain research and the arts.
    As an added bonus, a lecture on perception, action, cognition and emotions
    will be taught by an acclaimed neuroscientists, Prof. Israel Nelken..</p>

Title:  Online Games: Literature, New Media, and Narrative
Short desc:  Focused on Tolkien and The Lord of the Rings Online, this course explores what happens to stories and films when they are turned into online games.
Long desc:  <p><span>Intended for both newcomers who are
curious about video games and hard-core gamers who want to reflect on their
passion, this course will explore what happens to stories, paintings, and films
when they become the basis of massively multiplayer online games.  <i>The
Lord of the Rings </i>trilogy—the novels, films, and video game—are our central
example of how “remediation” transforms familiar stories as they move across
media.  </span></p><p><span>The course is
designed as a university-level English literature class—a multi-genre,
multimedia tour of how literature, film, and games engage in the basic human
activity of storytelling.  Our journey
will enable us to learn something about narrative theory, introduce us to some
key topics in media studies and cover some of the history and theory of video
games.  It will also take us to some
landmarks of romance literature, the neverending story that lies behind most
fantasy games: J.R.R. Tolkien’s <i>The
Fellowship of the Ring</i>, a bit of Edmund Spenser’s <i>Faerie Queene</i>, and poems by Keats, Tennyson, Browning, and others.</span></p>

<p>Drawing on centuries
of romance narrative conventions, the twenty-first century gaming industry has
become a creative and economic powerhouse. 
It engages the talents of some of our brightest writers, artists,
composers, computer engineers, game theorists, video producers, and marketing
professionals, and in 2012, it generated an estimated $64 billion in revenue.  Anyone interested in today’s culture needs to
be conversant with the ways this new medium is altering our understanding of
stories.  Join me as we set out on an
intellectual adventure, the quest to discover the cultural heritage of online
games.</p>

Title:  Natural Language Processing
Short desc:  Have you ever wondered how to build a system that automatically translates between languages? Or a system that can understand natural language instructions from a human?  This class will cover the fundamentals of mathematical and computational models of language, and the application of these models to key problems in natural language processing.
Long desc:  <p>Natural language processing (NLP) deals with the application of computational models to text or speech data. Application areas within NLP include automatic (machine) translation between languages; dialogue systems, which allow a human to interact with a machine using natural language; and information extraction, where the goal is to transform unstructured text into structured (database) representations that can be searched and browsed in flexible ways. NLP technologies are having a dramatic impact on the way people interact with computers, on the way people interact with each other through the use of language, and on the way people access the vast amount of linguistic data now in electronic form. From a scientific viewpoint, NLP involves fundamental questions of how to structure formal models (for example statistical models) of natural language phenomena, and of how to design algorithms that implement these models.</p>

<p>In this course you will study mathematical and computational models of language, and the application of these models to key problems in natural language processing. The course has a focus on machine learning methods, which are widely used in modern NLP systems: we will cover formalisms such as hidden Markov models, probabilistic context-free grammars, log-linear models, and statistical models for machine translation. The curriculum closely follows a course currently taught by Professor Collins at Columbia University, and previously taught at MIT.</p>

Title:  Science, Technology, and Society in China I: Basic Concepts
Short desc:  What are science, technology, and innovation? How do science, technology, and innovation inform our understanding of developments in the social sphere? How have these domains evolved in the Chinese context? In this course, we will examine these issues and attempt answering these and many other questions!
Long desc:  Science and technology continue to play an increasingly central role in
our lives, not least in countries such as China that are undergoing rapid
technological, economic and social change.&nbsp;This course is the first
of a trilogy of short courses on science, technology, and society in China.
Here, we explore in general terms how engineering as well as scientific
knowledge and practice are influenced by dynamic interactions between science,
technology, innovation, and society.&nbsp;The course will introduce the
innovation systems approach, laying the groundwork for mastering the remaining
two parts of the course by introducing broad concepts and ideas to provide
students with a platform on which to think about the science/technology–society
relationship and related policy issues with a focus on China.&nbsp;This
understanding will then be applied more specifically to China in the next
two courses in the series. <b><u><a href="https://www.coursera.org/course/stschina2">Part II</a></u></b> will examine the impact of the Industrial
Revolution in the West on scientific and technological progress in China.
<b><u><a href="https://www.coursera.org/course/stschina3">Part III</a></u></b> will examine science and technology in Chinese society today and
the basis for the policy prescriptions the Chinese government is currently
employing to promote innovation and technology development.

Title:  A New History for a New China, 1700-2000: New Data and New Methods, Part 1
Short desc:  The purpose of this course is to summarize some of the new directions in Chinese history and Chinese social science produced by the discovery and analysis of new historical data, in particular archival documents and datasets, and to organize this knowledge in a framework that encourages learning about China in comparative perspective.
Long desc:  <p>Our course demonstrates how a new scholarship of discovery is redefining
    what is singular about modern China and modern Chinese history. The current
    understanding of human history and social theory is based largely on Western
    experience or on non-Western experience seen through a Western lens. This
    course offers alternative perspectives derived from Chinese experience
    during the last three centuries. We present specific case studies of the
    new scholarship of discovery divided into three independent parts, which
    means that students can take any Part without prior or subsequent attendance
    of the other Parts. Part 1 addresses the issue of “Who Gets What” and covers
    sequentially inequality and education, education and social mobility, social
    mobility and wealth distribution, and wealth distribution and regime change.
    Part 2 turns to the related issue of “Who Survives” and includes studies
    of inequality and population behavior, population behavior and human development,
    human development and social organization, and social organization and
    social stratification. Part 3 deals with issues of identification and motivation
    and presents studies of religion and gender, ethnicity, and nationalism
    from late imperial times to the present-day.</p>
<p>Our class eschews the standard chronological narrative arc for an analytic
    approach that focuses on specific discoveries and on how these new facts
    complicate our understanding of comparative societies, human behavior,
    and the construction of individual and group identities. That being said,
    while we do not emphasize the temporal narratives of late imperial, early
    modern and contemporary China, we of course also discuss change over time
    as China progresses from a largely domestic imperial history to the shared
    stories of imperialism and semi colonialism, communism and collectivization,
    and reform and globalization.</p>

Title:  Fantasy and Science Fiction: The Human Mind, Our Modern World
Short desc:  We understand the world — and our selves — through stories. Then some of those hopes and fears become the world.
Long desc:  Fantasy is a key term both in psychology and in the art and artifice of
humanity. The things we make, including our stories, reflect, serve, and
often shape our needs and desires. We see this everywhere from fairy tale
to kiddie lit to myth; from "Cinderella" to <i>Alice in Wonderland </i>to <i>Superman</i>;
from building a fort as a child to building ideal, planned cities as whole
societies. Fantasy in ways both entertaining and practical serves our persistent
needs and desires and illuminates the human mind. Fantasy expresses itself
in many ways, from the comfort we feel in the godlike powers of a fairy
godmother to the seductive unease we feel confronting Dracula. From a practical
viewpoint, of all the fictional forms that fantasy takes, science fiction,
from <i>Frankenstein</i> to <i>Avatar</i>, is the most important in our modern
world because it is the only kind that explicitly recognizes the profound
ways in which science and technology, those key products of the human mind,
shape not only our world but our very hopes and fears. This course will
explore Fantasy in general and Science Fiction in specific both as art
and as insights into ourselves and our world.

Title:  MOS Transistors
Short desc:  Learn how MOS transistors work, and how to model them. The understanding provided in this course is essential not only for device modelers, but also for designers of high-performance circuits.

Long desc:  The MOS transistor (MOSFET) is the workhorse of the microelectronic revolution. It is&nbsp;estimated that there are currently over&nbsp;1 billion transistors per human being in the world. Part of the MOS transistor's success lies in its very small size (you can fit 1,000 of them within the <i>width</i> of a human hair!), part lies on some amazing things this device&nbsp;can do. However, the descriptions of MOS transistors in basic electronics courses cannot begin to do&nbsp;justice to this device.&nbsp;If you want to really know how the MOSFET&nbsp;operates, and how to model it, you need to study it carefully and systematically. This course will help you do just that.&nbsp;<br>
<br>The course starts with a review of basic physical principles, and expands into a detailed treatment of MOS transistor phenomena, in a logical and systematic fashion, enhanced by intuitive discussions. We discuss a hierarchy of models - from the simple to the sophisticated - clearly identifying the connections between them, and encompassing many aspects of modeling, including dc, large-signal transient operation, quasi-static operation, non-quasi-static operation, small-signal operation,&nbsp;noise, and structural effects. We discuss the concepts on which&nbsp;the most popular CAD (computer-aided design) MOS transistor models are based.<br><br>

Title:  Machine Learning
Short desc:  Learn about the most effective machine learning techniques, and gain practice implementing them and getting them to work for yourself.
Long desc:  <p>Machine learning is the science of getting computers to act without being
    explicitly programmed. In the past decade, machine learning has given us
    self-driving cars, practical speech recognition, effective web search,
    and a vastly improved understanding of the human genome. Machine learning
    is so pervasive today that you probably use it dozens of times a day without
    knowing it. Many researchers also think it is the best way to make progress
    towards human-level AI. In this class, you will learn about the most effective
    machine learning techniques, and gain practice implementing them and getting
    them to work for yourself. More importantly, you'll learn about not only
    the theoretical underpinnings of learning, but also gain the practical
    know-how needed to quickly and powerfully apply these techniques to new
    problems. Finally, you'll learn about some of Silicon Valley's best practices
    in innovation as it pertains to machine learning and AI.</p>
<p>This course provides a broad introduction to machine learning, datamining,
    and statistical pattern recognition. Topics include: (i) Supervised learning
    (parametric/non-parametric algorithms, support vector machines, kernels,
    neural networks). (ii) Unsupervised learning (clustering, dimensionality
    reduction, recommender systems, deep learning). (iii) Best practices in
    machine learning (bias/variance theory; innovation process in machine learning
    and AI). The course will also draw from numerous case studies and applications,
    so that you'll also learn how to apply learning algorithms to building
    smart robots (perception, control), text understanding (web search, anti-spam),
    computer vision, medical informatics, audio, database mining, and other
    areas.</p>

Title:  Surviving Disruptive Technologies
Short desc:   The purpose of this course is to help participants and the organizations they encounter survive the waves of technological disruptions facing business, government, education and their daily lives.
Long desc:  <p><b></b></p><p>The purpose of this course is to help individuals and organizations
survive when confronted with disruptive technologies that threaten their
current way of life.&nbsp; We will look at a
general model of survival and use it to analyze companies and industries that
have failed or are close to failing.&nbsp; Examples
of companies that have not survived include Kodak, a firm over 100 years old,
Blockbuster and Borders.&nbsp;&nbsp; It is likely
that each of us has done business with all of these firms, and today Kodak and
Blockbuster are in bankruptcy and Borders has been liquidated.&nbsp; Disruptions are impacting industries like
education; Coursera and others offering these massive open online courses are a
challenge for Universities.&nbsp; In addition
to firms that have failed, we will look at some that have survived and are
doing well.&nbsp; What are their strategies
for survival?<br></p>

<p>By highlighting the reasons for the decline of firms and
industries, participants can begin to understand how to keep the same thing
from happening to them.&nbsp;&nbsp; Through the
study of successful organizations, we will try to tease out approaches to
disruptions that actually work.&nbsp; Our
ultimate objective is to develop a strategy for survival in a world confronting
one disruptive technology after another.</p>

Title:  Gamification
Short desc:  Gamification is the application of game elements and digital game design techniques to non-game problems, such as business and social impact challenges. This course will teach you the mechanisms of gamification, why it has such tremendous potential, and how to use it effectively.
Long desc:  <div>Gamification is the application of digital game design techniques to non-game problems, such as business and social impact challenges. Video games are the dominant entertainment form of our time because they are powerful tools for motivating behavior.
    Effective games leverage both psychology and technology, in ways that can be applied outside the immersive environments of games themselves. Gamification as a business practice has exploded over the past two years. Organizations are applying it in
    areas such as marketing, human resources, productivity enhancement, sustainability, training, health and wellness, innovation, and customer engagement. Game thinking means more than just dropping in badges and leaderboards; it requires a thoughtful
    understanding of motivation and design techniques. This course examines the mechanisms of gamification and provides an understanding of its effective use.

Title:  Web Intelligence and Big Data
Short desc:  This course is about building 'web-intelligence' applications exploiting big data sources arising social media, mobile devices and sensors, using new big-data platforms based on the 'map-reduce' parallel programming paradigm. During the fall semester this course is offered at the Indian Institute of Technology Delhi as well as the Indraprastha Institute of Information Technology Delhi. 
Long desc:  The past decade has witnessed the successful of application of many AI techniques used at `web-scale’, on what are popularly referred to as big data platforms based on the map-reduce parallel computing paradigm and associated technologies such as distributed file systems, no-SQL databases and stream computing engines. Online advertising, machine translation, natural language understanding, sentiment mining, personalized medicine, and national security are some examples of such AI-based web-intelligence applications that are already in the public eye. Others, though less apparent, impact the operations of large enterprises from sales and marketing to manufacturing and supply chains. In this course we explore some such applications, the AI/statistical techniques that make them possible, along with parallel implementations using map-reduce and related platforms.

Title:  Leading Strategic Innovation in Organizations
Short desc:  Improve your ability to manage creativity and to lead an innovation strategy in businesses, schools, hospitals, governments, and other complex organizations and institutions, by diagnosing likely innovation failures before they occur.
Long desc:  <span>This
course is intended to help you improve your ability to manage creativity,
innovation and change in business, education, healthcare, government, and in
any other complex organization or institution by diagnosing potential
innovation failures before they can occur. Using an “<span>innovation constraints<i>”</i></span> framework that draws on modern social
science research and on insights from business practice, participants will
learn how to best manage people (be they co-workers, bosses, customers,
clients, friends or any other stakeholders) when innovation is the goal.&nbsp;
While we see several examples of technological innovation, we are not focused
on the management of technology.&nbsp;
Instead, we focus on something much more powerful:&nbsp; understanding and managing the people engaged
in creation, innovation and positive change, regardless of the context. </span>

<p>The course is
designed to help you answer the following types of questions:</p>

<ul><li>What are the conditions for successful
     innovation?</li><li>What causes innovation to fail?</li><li>What makes creative people creative?</li><li>How should I manage an innovative team?</li><li>How do I lead an effective brainstorm process?</li><li>What is an innovation portfolio and how can
     I manage one?</li><li>Why do so many great ideas get killed?</li></ul>

<p><span>The approach in this
class will be to treat innovation as the process of <i>generating</i>, <i>assessing</i>,
and then <i>implementing</i> useful and valuable ideas.&nbsp; As we will
discuss, generating ideas is relatively easy; what can be hard is getting those
ideas listened to, accepted, and implemented in organizations.&nbsp; In
addition to learning how to lead creative people and creative teams, participants
will also learn techniques for improving their own creativity.&nbsp; During the
course you will engage numerous activities and exercises intended to bring
current habits of thought and behavior to the surface for examination and
change.<br></span></p>

Title:  The Social Context of Mental Health and Illness
Short desc:  Learn how social factors promote mental health, influence the onset and course of mental illness, and affect how mental illnesses are diagnosed and treated.
Long desc:  Mental health and mental illness used to be something that people didn’t
talk about, but now it seems every time we open a newspaper we are hearing
about the importance of mental health, or the consequences of mental illness.
At this point in our history we understand mental illness and mental health
to be largely influenced by biological factors, specifically, workings
of the brain. At the same time, we have always known that social factors
play a very strong role in promoting mental health and can make big differences
in who gets mentally ill, who gets treated for mental illness, and how
people can achieve good quality of life after a mental health diagnosis.
<br>
<br>This course is an opportunity to explore how social practices and ideas
contribute to the ways in which society, families and individuals are affected
by mental health and mental illness. We will look at issues like why some
people think mental illness is a myth, how people think about mental health
and illness in different cultures, who gets mentally ill and why, how families
are affected by mental illness and what interventions are available to
treat mental illness and promote mental health.

Title:  Principles of Microeconomics
Short desc:  Learn how markets work, what they accomplish well and what their limitations are.
Long desc:  <p>
	
	
	


</p><p>We make economics
decisions every day: what to buy, whether to work or play, what to
study. We respond to markets all the time: prices influence our
decisions, markets signal where to put effort, they direct firms to
produce certain goods over others. Economics is all around us. </p><p>This
course is a rigorous introduction to the microeconomic theory of
markets: why we have them, how they work, what they accomplish. We
will explore what outcomes they generate when they work well
and what happens when they do not. We will learn why governments are
important and when regulation and intervention is necessary. Examples
are taken from everyday life, from goods and services that we all
purchase and use. We will apply the theory to current events and
policy debates through weekly exercises. These will empower you to be
an educated, critical thinker who can understand, analyze and
evaluate market outcomes.

Title:  Introduction to Genetics and Evolution
Short desc:  A whirlwind introduction to evolution and genetics, from basic principles to current applications, including how disease genes are mapped and how we leverage evolutionary concepts to aid humanity.
Long desc:  Introduction to Genetics and Evolution is a college-level class being offered simultaneously to new students at <a target="_blank" href="http://biology.duke.edu/">Duke University</a>. The course gives interested people a very basic overview of some principles behind these very fundamental areas of biology.  We often hear about new "genome sequences," commercial kits that can tell you about your ancestry (including pre-human) from your DNA or disease predispositions, debates about the truth of evolution, why animals behave the way they do, and how people found "genetic evidence for natural selection."  This course provides the basic biology you need to understand all of these issues better, tries to clarify some misconceptions, and tries to prepare students for future, more advanced coursework in Biology.  No prior coursework is assumed.<br><br>

Title:  Analyse Numérique pour Ingénieurs
Short desc:  Ce cours contient les 7 premiers chapitres d'un cours donné aux étudiants bachelor de l'EPFL. Il est basé sur le livre "Introduction à l'analyse numérique", J. Rappaz M. Picasso, Ed. PPUR. Des outils de base sont décrits dans les 5 premiers chapitres. Les deux derniers chapitres abordent la question de la résolution numérique d'équations différentielles. 

Long desc:  L'analyse numérique fait partie de ce que l'on appelle aujourd'hui "Scientific Computing" ou encore "Computational Sciences". Il s'agit de faire des simulations numériques de phénomènes complexes, par exemple l'écoulement autour d'un avion, le retrait passé ou futur d'un glacier, ou encore des effets spéciaux pour l'industrie du cinéma. <br><br>Le cheminement permettant d'obtenir une simulation numérique est le suivant.<br><span><br>

<ul><li>Dérivation d'un modèle mathématique. Par exemple, dans le cas de la chute d'un corps, les équations de Newton "masse x accéleration = forces" permettent d'obtenir une équation différentielle, à laquelle il faut ajouter une condition initiale sur la position et sur la vitesse du corps.</li>
<br>
<li>Analyse mathématique : le modèle mathématique obtenu est-il bien posé ? Par exemple, l'existence d'une solution unique de l'équation différentielle demande que certaines conditions sur les forces soient satisfaites.<br></li>
<br>
<li>Analyse numérique : en général, la solution du modèle mathématique ne peut pas être obtenue de manière explicite. Il convient d'utiliser un algorithme permettant d'approcher la solution grâce à un ordinateur. Dans la mesure du possible on souhaite quantifier l'erreur entre la solution du modèle mathématique (que l'on ne connait pas) et son approximation numérique (que l'on va calculer sur un ordinateur). Pour le choix de l'algorithme, on tiendra compte du nombre d'opérations nécessaire au calcul de la solution approchée.</li>
<br>
<li>Implémentation sur ordinateur (programmation).</li>
<br>
<li>Tests, validation et comparaison avec l'expérience ou d'autres résultats numériques.<br></li></ul></span>

Title:  The Law of the European Union: An Introduction
Short desc:  The EU is the most successful supranational legal order to which 27 Member States have transferred sovereign rights. This course explores the functioning of the unique creature that is the EU, the impact of its laws on states, citizens and companies, and the current challenges it faces.
Long desc:  <p></p>
<p>In 2012, the EU received the Nobel Peace Prize for its decades-long contribution
    to the advancement of peace and reconciliation, democracy and human rights
    in Europe. War has become virtually unthinkable in the EU. When the first
    steps towards supranational cooperation - primarily targeted at preventing
    the rearmament of Germany - were made in the aftermath of World War Two,
    the Founding Fathers of the European integration construct could never
    have imagined this outcome in their wildest dreams. Over the years, the
    supranational cooperation would widen - from the original European Communities
    consisting of 6 Member States to the current Union of 27 Members – and
    deepen – from the originally almost purely economically inspired Communities
    to the current Union with a say in almost all areas of national competence.
    At the same time, problems with the Euro have plunged the EU in one of
    the biggest crises since its inception. This challenges lawmakers to tackle
    difficult questions about the continued existence of the Euro and the future
    direction of the European integration project.</p>
<p>This course will give the students an insight into the law of the EU,
    a vast and fascinating area of law which forms an integral part of the
    legal systems of its 27 Member States. The course is divided into three
    parts. In the first part, we will pay attention to the creation and the
    development of the EU, its institutional structure and functioning, and
    the specific nature and sources of EU law. In the second part, we will
    examine how EU law impacts on the lives of EU citizens as well as on companies
    that are established or provide services in the EU. In the final
    part, we will tackle Europe’s common currency crisis, investigating causes,
    effects and possible routes out of this existential crisis of the Union.</p>
<p>If you are a student, lawyer, entrepreneur or simply interested in the
    EU, its&nbsp;development and legal system, this course will provide you
    with the foundations.&nbsp;The course is of interest to people both inside
    and outside the European Union: EU citizens may learn how to benefit from
    the rights contained in EU life; people from other parts of the world may
    learn from the EU’s specific set-up, its functioning and the legal solutions
    being applied in the European context.</p>

Title:  A Brief History of Humankind
Short desc:  The course surveys the entire length of human history, from the evolution of various human species in the Stone Age up to the political and technological revolutions of the twenty-first century.
Long desc:  <p>About 2 million years ago our human
ancestors were&nbsp;insignificant animals living in a corner of Africa. Their impact on the world was no greater than
that of gorillas, zebras, or chickens. Today humans are spread all over the
world, and they are the most important animal around. The very future of life
on Earth depends on the ideas and behavior of our species. </p><p>This course will explain how we humans have conquered planet Earth, and how
we have changed our environment, our societies, and our own bodies and minds.
The aim of the course is to give students a brief but complete overview of
history, and to answer some basic historical questions such as:</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What is
religion?</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What is an
empire? </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What is
money?</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;What is
science?</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; What is
capitalism? &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Why did almost
all societies believe that women are inferior to men?</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Does
history have a direction?&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Did people
become happier as history progressed? </p><p>



















</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And what is
the likely future of humankind?&nbsp;</p>

Title:  Calculus One
Short desc:  Calculus One is a first introduction to differential and integral calculus, emphasizing engaging examples from everyday life.
Long desc:  Calculus is about the very large, the very small, and how things change.  The surprise is that something seemingly so abstract ends up explaining the real world.  Calculus plays a starring role in the biological, physical, and social sciences.  By focusing outside of the classroom, we will see examples of calculus appearing in daily life.<br><br>This course is a first and friendly introduction to calculus, suitable for someone who has never seen the subject before, or for someone who has seen some calculus but wants to review the concepts and practice applying those concepts to solve problems.  One learns calculus by doing calculus, and so this course encourages you to participate by providing you with:<br><br><ul><li>instant feedback on practice problems</li><li>interactive graphs and games for you to play</li><li>calculus projects and demos you can try at home</li><li>opportunities for you to explain your thought process</li></ul>

Title:  Introduction to Sustainability
Short desc:  This course introduces the academic discipline of sustainability and explores how today’s human societies can endure in the face of global change, ecosystem degradation and resource limitations.
Long desc:  <div>This course introduces the academic approach of Sustainability and explores how today’s human societies can endure in the face of global change, ecosystem degradation and resource limitations. The course focuses on key knowledge areas of sustainability theory and practice, including population, ecosystems, global change, energy, agriculture, water, environmental economics and policy, ethics, and cultural history.<br><br></div>
<div>This subject is of vital importance, seeking as it does to uncover the principles of the long-term welfare of all the peoples of the planet. As sustainability is a cross-disciplinary field of study, this foundation requires intellectual breadth: as I describe it in the class text, understanding our motivations requires the humanities, measuring the challenges of sustainability requires knowledge of the sciences (both natural and social), and building solutions requires technical insight into systems (such as provided by engineering, planning, and management).</div>

Title:  New Models of Business in Society
Short desc:  Examine the critical role that business plays in society, and learn about the exciting new models of business that are changing the way that companies create value.
Long desc:  <p>This course examines the emergence of a new story about
business. This new story locates
business within a societal framework. Almost every business creates or destroys value for customers,
suppliers, employees, communities and society, in addition to shareholders and
other financiers. A number of new models
of business can be built on this idea such as corporate
responsibility, philanthropy, shared value and sustainability. Profits and stakeholder value go together,
and this course explains how. The final
session explores the idea of how to become a stakeholder entrepreneur and
create a business that makes money and makes the world a better place.<br></p>

Title:  Genes and the Human Condition (From Behavior to Biotechnology)
Short desc:  To acquire an understanding of the fundamental concepts of genomics and biotechnology, and their implications for human biology, evolution, medicine, social policy and individual life path choices in the 21st century. 
Long desc:  <p>In this class we will cover the essentials of genomics to help you better
understand your own life (know thy genome, know thyself), and how advances in
biotechnology are radically changing the scientific landscape.</p>

<p>We will begin with some of the most basic issues
of genetics, such as the composition of genomes and how the information in them
is processed so we can get an adult human from an egg. Then we’ll see that much
of the power of genomics is in comparisons. If I only had your genome there's
not much I could do with it. But if I lined it up against a chimpanzee genome
I’d see that they are 98.5% identical. It’s that 1.5% difference that we study to
determine what makes a chimp a chimp and a human a human.  </p>

<p>In the next few years you’ll be able
to get your genome done for a few hundred dollars, and we will look at the
challenges you might face dealing with this new self-knowledge. We shall
particularly focus on behavior. How can genes predispose some of us to be nice
and others of us to be psychopaths? We will be examining behavior as a complex
unfolding of interactions between your genome and the environment. </p>

Thanks in large part to genomics we are
beginning to understand the living processes that constitute ourselves, where
we can begin to intervene to take control of our own future. We will look at
the technologies involved and the consequences of this new power. Genetic
engineering has already changed what you eat and the medicines you take, and will
likely therefore change how long you live. If we choose to genetically engineer
ourselves as some advocate then we may also change how we view ourselves as
human beings. We do not know where our ability to intervene in our own living
processes is going to lead us. Depending on your point of view that is the
promise or the threat of the era we live in. Scientists today already envisage
creating life from scratch, and we are entering a world where political considerations,
and imagination, may be the only brakes on biotechnology.

Title:  General Game Playing
Short desc:  Learn about General Game Playing (GGP) and develop GGP programs capable of competing against humans and other programs in GGP competitions .
Long desc:  General game players are computer systems able to play strategy games
based solely on formal game descriptions supplied at "runtime". &nbsp;(In
other words, they don't know the rules until the game starts.) &nbsp;Unlike
specialized game players, such as Deep Blue, general game players cannot
rely on algorithms designed in advance for specific games; they must discover
such algorithms themselves. &nbsp;General game playing expertise depends
on intelligence on the part of the game player and not just intelligence
of the programmer of the game player.
<br>
<br>
<div>GGP is an interesting application in its own right. &nbsp;It is intellectually
    engaging and more than a little fun. &nbsp;But it is much more than that.
    &nbsp;It provides a theoretical framework for modeling discrete dynamic
    systems and for defining rationality in a way that takes into account problem
    representation and complexities like incompleteness of information and
    resource bounds. &nbsp;It has practical applications in areas where these
    features are important, e.g. in business and law. &nbsp;More fundamentally,
    it raises questions about the nature of intelligence and serves as a laboratory
    in which to evaluate competing approaches to artificial intelligence.</div>
<br>This course is an introduction to General Game Playing (GGP). &nbsp;Students
will get an introduction to the theory of General Game Playing and will&nbsp;learn
how to create GGP programs capable of competing against other programs
and humans.

Title:  Modern & Contemporary American Poetry
Short desc:  ModPo is a fast-paced introduction to modern and contemporary U.S. poetry, with an emphasis on experimental verse, from Dickinson and Whitman to the present. Participants (who need no prior experience with poetry) will learn how to read poems that are supposedly "difficult."
Long desc:  In this fast-paced course we will read and encounter and discuss a great range of modern and contemporary U.S. poets working in the "experimental mode," starting with the 19th-century proto-modernists Emily Dickinson and Walt Whitman and ending with 21st-century conceptual poetics. Aside from providing a perhaps handy or helpful survey and chronology of 20th- and 21st-century poetry, this course offers a way of understanding general cultural transitions from modernism to postmodernism. Some people may wish to enroll as much to gain an understanding of the modernism/postmodernism problem through a study of poetry as to gain access to the work of these many poets. Participants do not need to have any prior knowledge of poetry or poetics. The instructor, Al Filreis, rarely lectures, and frequently calls for "the end of the lecture as we know it"; instead, the video-recorded lessons will consist of collaborative close readings led by Filreis, seminar-style -- offering models or samples of readers' interpretations of these knotty but powerful poems, aided by the poetry-minded denizens of the Kelly Writers House on the campus of the University of Pennsylvania.

Title:  TechniCity
Short desc:  We live in real-time, technologically enhanced cities. <br>Explore the sweeping changes that our cities are undergoing as a result of networks, sensors, and communication technology.
Long desc:  <b></b>We are part of the 'TechniCity'. The increasing availability of
networks, sensors and mobile technologies allows for new approaches to
address the challenges that our cities face. The way we understand cities
is undergoing sweeping transformation, right along with the analytical
tools we use to design our cities and the communication tools we use to
engage people. Absorbing, studying and understanding the role of technology
from a critical viewpoint allows us to generate creative ideas for improving
our cities. 
<br>
<br>This course begins by examining how our cities are changing. We then jump
into how technology is used to engage with the public to support decision-making and the creative ways that every-day people are using technology to improve their cities.  
Students will be examining tools for analyzing the city. Then we move into exploring the fascinating ways that cities are using real-time, technology. You'll hear from technological innovators and thought leaders about all of these topics. You will get to engage around a topic you are most interested in to create a project in your own city.

Title:  Introduction to Logic
Short desc:  In this course, you will learn how to formalize information and reason systematically to produce logical conclusions. We will also examine logic technology and its applications - in mathematics, science, engineering, business, law, and so forth.
Long desc:  <p>Logic is one of the oldest intellectual disciplines in human history.
    It dates back to the times of Aristotle; it has been studied through the
    centuries; and it is still a subject of active investigation today.</p>
<p>This course is a basic introduction to Logic. It shows how to formalize
    information in form of logical sentences. It shows how to reason systematically
    with this information to produce all logical conclusions and only logical
    conclusions. And it examines logic technology and its applications - in
    mathematics, science, engineering, business, law, and so forth.</p>
<p>The course differs from other introductory courses in Logic in two important
    ways. First of all, it teaches a novel theory of logic that improves accessibility
    while preserving rigor. Second, the material is laced with interactive
    demonstrations and exercises that suggest the many practical applications
    of the field.</p>

Title:  Introductory Physics I with Laboratory
Short desc:  Explore motion in the real world using modern tools and techniques (video capture and analysis, computer modeling) guided by fundamental physics principles.
Long desc:  <div>
    <p>We will investigate motion in the world around us; we welcome both those
        who want to participate fully and those who wish to sample, cafeteria-style,
        the activities of this course. &nbsp;Those who participate fully will experience
        a course that is very different in style but equivalent (at least) in core
        content to a traditional, on-campus, first-semester college-level introductory
        physics course that includes a laboratory. At the same time, those who
        cherry-pick selected course elements (e.g., learning the basics of video
        capture and analysis of motion in one’s own surroundings) will still advance
        their understanding of physics. &nbsp;&nbsp;
        <br>
    </p>
    <p>We aim to understand and to predict motion in the real world using a small
        set of powerful fundamental principles. The laboratories are the backbone
        of this course, providing opportunities (1) to observe and to analyze motion
        in our own surroundings, (2) to apply fundamental principles to build explanations
        of the motion, and (3) to evaluate, in a constructively critical way, our
        own measurements and models, as well as the measurements and models of
        our course peers. Other course elements (lecture videos with “clicker”
        questions, homework) support and extend the physics explored in the laboratories.</p>Participants
    who satisfactorily complete the course will be eligible for six (6) Continuing
    Education Units from the American Association of Physics Teachers.&nbsp;</div>

Title:  Networks: Friends, Money, and Bytes
Short desc:  A course driven by 20 practical questions about wireless, web, and the Internet, about how products from companies like Apple, Google, Facebook, Netflix, Amazon, Ericsson, HP, Skype and AT&T work.

In this offering, we will cover 7 of the 20 questions, and you will have the opportunity to personalize your own learning experience by choosing which of the versions suits you best.
Long desc:  You pick up your iPhone while waiting in line at a coffee shop. You google a not-so-famous actor, get linked to a Wikipedia entry listing his recent movies and popular YouTube clips of several of them. You check out user reviews on Amazon and pick one,
download that movie on BitTorrent or stream that in Netflix. But suddenly the WiFi logo on your phone is gone and you're on 3G. Video quality starts to degrade, but you don't know if it's the server getting crowded or the Internet is congested somewhere.
In any case, it costs you $10 per Gigabyte, and you decide to stop watching the movie, and instead multitask between sending tweets and calling your friend on Skype, while songs stream from iCloud to your phone. You're happy with the call quality, but
get a little irritated when you see there're no new followers on Twitter. You may wonder how they all kind of work, and why sometimes they don't. Take a look at the list of 20 questions below. Each question is selected not just for its relevance to our
daily lives, but also for the core concepts in the field of networking illustrated by its answers. This course is about formulating and answering some of these 20 questions.

Long desc:  <div>This course is designed to help students with very little or no computing
    background learn the basics of building simple interactive applications.
    &nbsp;Our language of choice, Python, is an easy-to learn, high-level computer
    language that is used in many of the computational courses offered on Coursera.
    To make learning Python easy, we have developed a new browser-based programming
    environment that makes developing interactive applications in Python simple.
    &nbsp;These applications will involve windows whose contents are graphical
    and respond to buttons, the keyboard and the mouse.
    <br>
    <br>The primary method for learning the course material will be to work through
    multiple "mini-projects" in Python. &nbsp;To make this class enjoyable,
    these projects will include building fun games such as Pong, Blackjack,
    and Asteroids. &nbsp;When you’ve finished our course, we can’t promise
    that you will be a professional programmer, but we think that you will
    learn a lot about programming in Python and have fun while you’re doing
    it.</div>

Title:  Probabilistic Graphical Models
Short desc:  In this class, you will learn the basics of the PGM representation and how to construct them, using both human knowledge and machine learning techniques.
Long desc:  <p><strong>What are Probabilistic Graphical Models?</strong></p>
<p>Uncertainty is unavoidable in real-world applications: we can almost never predict with certainty what will happen in the future, and even in the present and the past, many important aspects of the world are not observed with certainty. Probability theory gives us the basic foundation to model our beliefs about the different possible states of the world, and to update these beliefs as new evidence is obtained. These beliefs can be combined with individual preferences to help guide our actions, and even in selecting which observations to make. While probability theory has existed since the 17th century, our ability to use it effectively on large problems involving many inter-related variables is fairly recent, and is due largely to the development of a framework known as Probabilistic Graphical Models (PGMs). This framework, which spans methods such as Bayesian networks and Markov random fields, uses ideas from discrete data structures in computer science to efficiently encode and manipulate probability distributions over high-dimensional spaces, often involving hundreds or even many thousands of variables. These methods have been used in an enormous range of application domains, which include: web search, medical and fault diagnosis, image understanding, reconstruction of biological networks, speech recognition, natural language processing, decoding of messages sent over a noisy communication channel, robot navigation, and many more. The PGM framework provides an essential tool for anyone who wants to learn how to reason coherently from limited and noisy observations.</p>
In this class, you will learn the basics of the PGM representation and how to construct them, using both human knowledge and machine learning techniques; you will also learn algorithms for using a PGM to reach conclusions about the world from limited and noisy evidence, and for making good decisions under uncertainty. The class covers both the theoretical underpinnings of the PGM framework and practical skills needed to apply these techniques to new problems.

Long desc:  <p>
    <br>How can we use computers to create expressive, compelling music? And how
    can we write computer software to help us create and organize sounds in
    new ways? This course provides a hands-on introduction to the field of
    music technology as both a creative musical practice and an interdisciplinary
    technical research pursuit. Through the exploration of topics such as acoustics,
    psychoacoustics, digital sound, digital signal processing, audio synthesis,
    spectral analysis, algorithmic composition, and music information retrieval,
    we will explore the deep relationships between art and science, between
    theory and practice, and between experimental and popular electronic music.</p>We will learn about these topics in the context of digital audio
workstation (DAW) software, the multi-track editing paradigm that has been
dominant in music production since the 1980s. As we learn about the foundations
behind such software, we will use this knowledge to more effectively create
music with it, and we will also write a series of short software programs
that extend the software’s ability to manipulate, transform, and analyze
sound.<br><br><b>Grading Policy:</b><br><p>There will be a quiz at the end of each module (except module 0) for a total of 6 quizzes. Quizzes consist of multiple-choice and short-response questions and cover lecture material from the module.</p><p>There are two hands-on projects in the course, due at the end of module 3 and at the end of module 5. These projects will be graded through a peer assessment system.</p><p>The grade breakdown is as follows:</p><ul><li>60% - quizzes</li><li>40% - projects</li></ul><p>In order to receive a statement of accomplishment, you must get 70% or higher for the course. In order to receive a statement of accomplishment with distinction, you must get 90% or higher for the course.</p>

Title:  Digital Signal Processing
Short desc:  Learn the fundamentals of digital signal processing theory and discover the myriad ways DSP makes everyday life more productive and fun.
Long desc:  The goal of the course is to develop a complete working set of digital signal processing notions from the ground up. DSP is arguably at the heart of the “digital revolution” that, in the space of just a few decades, has enabled unprecedented levels of interpersonal communication and of information availability. <br><br> In the class, starting from the basic definitions of a discrete-time signal, we will work our way through Fourier analysis, filter design, sampling, interpolation and quantization to build a DSP toolset complete enough to analyze a practical communication system in detail. Hands-on examples and demonstration will be routinely used to close the gap between theory and practice.

Title:  "Pay Attention!!" ADHD Through the Lifespan
Short desc:  This course reviews current scientific knowledge and clinical approaches to Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) and examines its impact on development, functioning and health outcomes.
Long desc:  It is estimated that 5-8% of school-aged children and 4% of adults in the United States suffer from some form of attention deficit disorder and that the incidence of the disorder is increasing in the population. Although it is the most widely studied behavior disorder of childhood, its etiology remains unclear, its outcome is variable, and its treatment is complex and moderately successful. Advances in neuroscience have provided new insights into the pathophysiology of ADHD, pointing to key neural circuits involved in attention, behavioral control, learning, and reward maintenance that appear to be underperforming in patients with the disorder. Moreover, the etiology of this heterogeneous disorder points to the key role of genetic and environmental interactions during prenatal and perinatal periods. Over the past decade, new diagnostic and interventional approaches have enabled clinicians to better diagnose and treat ADHD across the lifespan, while longitudinal studies have elucidated the long-term impact of the disorder on health and adaptive functioning.<br><br>This course is intended for students with a background in psychology and/or neuroscience who are interested in learning more about the complexities of ADHD from both scientific and clinical perspectives. Scientific topics covered include prevalence and epidemiology, diagnostic criteria, clinical presentation at different ages, impact on development (intellect, academic, speech and language, emotional self control, motivation and executive functioning), health outcomes (risk taking, accidents, injuries, driving difficulties, unintended pregnancy), co-existing conditions (anxiety, mood, substance use disorders), and etiology (genetic, pre/perinatal, neurodevelopmental, neuroanatomic, neuropsychological). Clinical topics covered include approaches to assessment, medication treatments (stimulant and non-stimulant), and non-medical interventions.

Course ID:  970426
Title:  Bioelectricity: A Quantitative Approach
Short desc:  Nerves, the heart, and the brain are electrical. How do these things work? This course presents fundamental principles, described quantitatively.
Long desc:  <p>In this class you will learn how to think about electrically active
tissue in terms of individual mechanisms, and you will learn to analyze the
mechanisms quantitatively as well as describe them qualitatively. &nbsp;The
course uses many of the same examples used by Hodgkin and Huxley, who won the
Nobel Prize for their experimental unraveling of the mechanisms of the nerve
axon of the giant squid, and their creation of a mathematical model of
membranes and propagation to understand its function. &nbsp;That work has been
the foundational element of most subsequent understandings of electrically
active tissue, whether in nerves, the brain or in muscle, including the heart. 
</p>
<p>
In this course, topics include:
</p><ol>
<li>The electrical charging of active membranes from the creation and use of differences in ionic concentrations across the membrane.</li>
<li>The stimulation of the membrane, both naturally and from engineered sources.</li>
<li>The creation of action potentials by the membrane in response to stimulation.</li>
<li>The chain reaction of membrane responses, with each small region or cell initiating an action potential in adjacent ones.</li>
<li>The observation of associated electrical currents in terms of extracellular wave voltages they create, the basis of clinical measurements such as the electrocardiogram.</li>
</ol>
<p></p>
<p>
The course will at each step present equations and other quantitative reasoning so that you will be able to go beyond describing what happens qualitatively and be able to link together the phenomena in the mosaic in a quantitative fashion, which is essential to judging whether specific changes in inputs are important to the outcome. Through the use of quantitative analysis, you will learn that all the elements of the system are tied together and be able to link together and analyze the effects of one part on another.

Title:  Introduction to Psychology as a Science
Short desc:  Learn about how psychology has developed a body of knowledge about behavior and mind through the use of scientific methods. All areas of psychology will be covered.
Long desc:  Since we were young children, we have tried to understand, to predict,
and to control behavior. We first dealt with our parents and teachers,
and later our friends and companions. This course shows, however,
how the understanding, prediction, and control of behavior require scientific
validation. By using tools that are systematic and objective, psychology
has learned how people behave and think.
<br>
<br>Psychology is a very broad field of study and the course will include
discussions of the brain and nervous system, sensation and perception,
learning, memory, intelligence and thinking, lifespan development, emotion
and motivation, personality, social behavior, behavioral disorders, and
psychological treatment of disorders. The course will include short
lecture modules, demonstrations and experiments, and writing assignments.

Title:  Introduction to Psychology
Short desc:  This course is all about you ... your mind, your behavior, and what underlies them both.  It will be a fast paced tour of the most important experiments in psychology, one that is intended to fascinate, inform, and provoke deep thought.  Come learn about yourself with us!
Long desc:  This course will highlight the most interesting experiments within the
field of psychology, discussing the implications of those studies for our
understanding of the human mind and human behavior. &nbsp;We will explore
the brain and some of the cognitive abilities it supports like memory,
learning, attention, perception and consciousness. &nbsp;We will examine
human development - both in terms of growing up and growing old - and will
discuss the manner in which the behavior of others affect our own thoughts
and behavior. &nbsp;Finally we will discuss various forms of mental illness
and the treatments that are used to help those who suffer from them. &nbsp;
<br>
<br>The fact of the matter is that humans routinely do amazing things without
appreciating how interesting they are. &nbsp;However, we are also routinely
influenced by people and events without always being aware of those influences.
&nbsp;By the end of this course you will have gained a much better understanding
and appreciation of who you are and how you work. &nbsp;And I can guarantee
you that you'll learn things that you'll be telling your friends and family
about, things that will fundamentally change the way you think of yourself
and others. &nbsp;How can you resist that?!

mathematical theory of two player games without chance moves. We will cover
simplifying games, determining when games are equivalent to numbers, and
impartial games. Many of the examples will be with simple games that may be new
to you: Hackenbush, Nim, Push, Toads and Frogs, and others. While this probably
won’t make you a better chess or go player, the course will give you a better
insight into the structure of games.

Title:  Big Data in Education
Short desc:  Education is increasingly occurring online or in educational software, 
resulting in an explosion of data 
that can be used to improve educational effectiveness and
support basic research on learning. In this course, you will learn how
and when to use key methods for educational data mining and
learning analytics on this data.
Long desc:  The emerging research communities in educational
data mining and<span><br>
learning analytics are developing methods for mining and modeling the increasing
amounts of fine-grained data becoming available about<br>
learners. In this class, you will learn about
these methods, and their<br>
strengths and weaknesses for different applications. You will learn how to
use each method to answer education research questions and to drive intervention and improvement in
educational software and systems. Methods will be covered both at a theoretical level, and in terms of how
to apply and execute them using standard software tools. Issues of validity and generalizability will
also be covered, towards learning to establish how trustworthy and applicable the results of an analysis are.</span>

Title:  Community Change in Public Health
Short desc:  This course examines the community context of the changes needed to promote the public’s health.
Long desc:  <div>In bringing about behavior change in public health, we often focus on
    the individual mother, student, or farmer. We should not forget the community
    structure and norms constrain for encouraging individual health behaviors.
    This course examines the community context of the changes needed to promote
    the public’s health. We begin by examining the various definitions of ‘community’
    and the processes by which we ‘diagnose’ or seek to understand the structure
    and characteristics of different types of communities. An appreciation
    of community similarities and differences is necessary lest we fall into
    the trap of designing one-size-fits-all interventions. We need to recognize
    that no matter that outsiders may view a community as poor or neglected,
    we can find strengths and capacities for improvement in each community.
    Identifying community capacities and resources is the first step in facilitating
    community change. Different practical and philosophical approaches to change
    and therefore, examined. Specific to the change process is our recognition
    of the need for communities to participate in the design, implementation
    and evaluation of any intervention. We examine the concept of participation
    in an effort to see how different levels of involvement may affect sustainability
    of community change efforts. Finally a case study of a community participatory
    approach to onchocerciasis control in Africa is presented. Community Directed
    Intervention has subsequently been successfully applied to providing other
    essential primary health care services by and in the community, such as
    insecticide treated bednets, malaria treatment, vitamin A distribution,
    deworming medicines, and pneumonia and diarrhea case management.

Title:  Game Theory
Short desc:  The course covers the basics: representing games and strategies, the extensive form (which computer scientists call game trees), repeated and stochastic games, coalitional games, and Bayesian games (modeling things like auctions).
Long desc:  Popularized by movies such as "A Beautiful Mind", game theory is the mathematical modeling of strategic interaction among rational (and irrational) agents. Beyond what we call 'games' in common language, such as chess, poker, soccer, etc., it includes the modeling of conflict among nations, political campaigns, competition among firms, and trading behavior in markets such as the NYSE. How could you begin to model eBay, Google keyword auctions, and peer to peer file-sharing networks, without accounting for the incentives of the people using them? The course will provide the basics: representing games and strategies, the extensive form (which computer scientists call game trees), Bayesian games (modeling things like auctions), repeated and stochastic games, and more. We'll include a variety of examples including classic games and real-world applications.

Title:  English Composition I: Achieving Expertise
Short desc:  You will gain a foundation for college-level writing valuable for nearly any field. Students will learn how to read carefully, write effective arguments, understand the writing process, engage with others' ideas, cite accurately, and craft powerful prose. We will create a workshop environment. 
Long desc:  <p>English Composition I provides an introduction to and foundation for the academic reading and writing characteristic of college. Attending explicitly to disciplinary context, you will learn to read critically, write effective arguments, understand the
    writing process, and craft powerful prose that meets readers’ expectations. You will gain writing expertise by exploring questions about expertise itself: What factors impact expert achievement? What does it take to succeed? Who determines success?
    Since personal investment yields better writing, you can select an area of expertise meaningful to you (a hobby, trade, profession, discipline, etc.) for your major writing projects, which will be drafted and revised in sequenced stages: a critical
    review to an argument about expertise (600-800 words); an explication of a visual image (600-800 words); a case study of an expert (1000-1250 words) and an Op-Ed (500-750 words). Your writing will be central to the course as we create a seminar/workshop
    structure with peer response and selected instructor feedback.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Two overarching assumptions about academic writing will shape our work:&nbsp; 1) it is transferable; 2) it is learnable. Being an effective academic writer involves asking meaningful questions and engaging in complex dialogue with texts and ideas. These
    skills are useful across virtually all academic disciplines and they provide a valuable means for making sense of non-academic experiences as well. Perhaps even more important, though, is that learning how to write effectively does not require inspiration
    or genius, but hard work, reflection, and feedback. This means that, with practice, dedication, and working with others,<i> you</i> can be an effective academic writer and contribute your ideas to important, ongoing conversations. Let's start now.</p><p><a title="Link: https://duke.qualtrics.com/SE/?SID=SV_eWEH2NWLXc39gJT" target="_blank" href="https://duke.qualtrics.com/SE/?SID=SV_eWEH2NWLXc39gJT">Share why you want to improve your writing</a></p><p><a target="_blank" href="https://duke.qualtrics.com/CP/Report.php?RP=RP_3a5VBt61u1FYim9">Learn what other says about their motivations</a><br></p><p><span>**English Composition I has earned a <a title="Link: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/composition%2Fquality%20matters%20certificate%5B2%5D.pdf" href="https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/composition%2Fquality%20matters%20certificate%5B2%5D.pdf">Certificate of Recognition</a> from Quality Matters, a non-profit dedicated to quality in online education.**

Title:  Learn to Program: The Fundamentals
Short desc:  Behind every mouse click and touch-screen tap, there is a computer program that makes things happen. This course introduces the fundamental building blocks of programming and teaches you how to write fun and useful programs using the Python language.
Long desc:  A computer program is a set of instructions for a computer to follow, just as a recipe is a set of instructions for a chef. Laptops, kitchen appliances, MP3 players, and many other electronic devices all run computer programs. Programs have been written to manipulate sound and video, write poetry, run banking systems, predict the weather, and analyze athletic performance. This course is intended for people who have never seen a computer program. It will give you a better understanding of how computer applications work and teach you how to write your own applications. More importantly, you’ll start to learn computational thinking, which is a fundamental approach to solving real-world problems. Computer programming languages share common fundamental concepts, and this course will introduce you to those concepts using the Python programming language. By the end of this course, you will be able to write your own programs to process data from the web and create interactive text-based games.

Title:  Functional Programming Principles in Scala
Short desc:  Learn about functional programming, and how it can be effectively combined with object-oriented programming. Gain practice in writing clean functional code, using the Scala programming language.
Long desc:  This course introduces the cornerstones of functional programming using the Scala programming language. Functional programming has become more and more popular in recent years because it promotes code that’s safe, concise, and elegant. Furthermore, functional programming makes it easier to write parallel code for today’s and tomorrow’s multiprocessors by replacing mutable variables and loops with powerful ways to define and compose functions. <br><br> Scala is a language that fuses functional and object-oriented programming in a practical package. It interoperates seamlessly with Java and its tools. Scala is now used in a rapidly increasing number of open source projects and companies. It provides the core infrastructure for sites such as Twitter, LinkedIn, Foursquare, Tumblr, and Klout. <br><br> In this course you will discover the elements of the functional programming style and learn how to apply them usefully in your daily programming tasks. You will also develop a solid foundation for reasoning about functional programs, by touching upon proofs of invariants and the tracing of execution symbolically. <br><br> The course is hands on; most units introduce short programs that serve as illustrations of important concepts and invite you to play with them, modifying and improving them. The course is complemented by a series of assignments, most of which are also programming projects.

Course ID:  970459
Title:  Vaccine Trials: Methods and Best Practices
Short desc:  This course will explore the process of evaluating investigational vaccines in clinical trials including informed consent, recruitment, enrollment, safety evaluation, and quality data collection.
Long desc:  <div>Vaccines are evaluated through a series of clearly defined controlled
    studies to assess these investigational products for safety, immunogenicity
    and efficacy before they are approved for licensure. &nbsp;All clinical
    vaccine trials are bound by international ethical guidelines and, in the
    case of US trials, Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulations.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Good Clinical Practice is defined by the International Conferences on
    Harmonization (ICH) as: “A standard for the design, conduct, performance,
    monitoring, auditing, recording, analysis, and reporting of clinical trials
    that provides assurance that the data and reported results are credible
    and accurate, and that the rights, integrity and confidentiality of trial
    subjects are protected.”</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>That’s a tall order, so how is it done? &nbsp;Individuals who enroll as
    subjects in these trials play an essential role in the development and
    evaluation of new and improved candidate vaccines. &nbsp;They are average
    citizens who volunteer to roll up their sleeves and, in the process, make
    a tremendous difference in society. &nbsp;So why do they volunteer and
    what safeguards do we put in place to protect their rights, safety and
    well-being while in the trial? &nbsp;What are the responsibilities of the
    investigators, sponsors and ethics committees who conduct and oversee these
    trials?&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Along with our colleagues, we will introduce you to how GCP is applied
    in clinical vaccine trials to ensure proper and ethical scientific conduct.
    The course will use examples from real vaccine trials to demonstrate the
    application of the FDA Code of Federal Regulations and ICH GCP Guidelines
    to explore methods and best practices involved in implementing phase I
    and II vaccine clinical trials. &nbsp;This short course offering through
    Coursera is based on our work at the Center for Immunization Research and
    an in-depth graduate course taught at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School
    of Public Health.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>We hope it inspires you to work in this exciting field.</div>

Title:  Principles of Obesity Economics
Short desc:  The resources available to individuals and society and the prices of goods in the market shape our choices - even about the food we eat and the weight at which we live. This course explores the economic motivation for consumer choice and the economic role of government in markets related to obesity.
Long desc:  Economics motivates consumer behavior based on preferences, relative prices,
and time and money constraints. &nbsp;Economics motivates the role for
government based on market failure. &nbsp;Obesity has been deemed a critical
public health problem. &nbsp;This course explores how consumer choices
lead to individuals being different weights and discusses whether there
is an economic rationale for government intervention in the markets most
closely related to food and activity choices.&nbsp;
<br>
<br><strong>Course Objectives</strong> 
<br>
<ul>
    <li>Define the concept of consumer sovereignty&nbsp;</li>
    <li>Describe how consumers are thought to make choices based on a combination
        of preferences, relatively prices, and time and money constraints&nbsp;</li>
    <li>Describe economic motivations for government action in markets&nbsp;</li>
    <li>Consider arguments regarding the appropriateness of a government role
        in markets that are related to obesity in adults and children</li>

Title:  Social Network Analysis
Short desc:  This course will use social network analysis, both its theory and computational tools, to make sense of the social and information networks that have been fueled and rendered accessible by the internet.
Long desc:  Everything is connected: people, information, events and places, all the more so with the advent of online social media. A practical way of making sense of the tangle of connections is to analyze them as networks. In this course you will learn about the structure and evolution of networks, drawing on knowledge from disciplines as diverse as sociology, mathematics, computer science, economics, and physics. Online interactive demonstrations and hands-on analysis of real-world data sets will focus on a range of tasks: from identifying important nodes in the network, to detecting communities, to tracing information diffusion and opinion formation.

Course ID:  970475
Title:  Model Thinking
Short desc:  In this class, you will learn how to think with models and use them to make sense of the complex world around us.
Long desc:  We live in a complex world with diverse people, firms, and governments whose behaviors aggregate to produce novel, unexpected phenomena. We see political uprisings, market crashes, and a never ending array of social trends. How do we make sense of it? Models. Evidence shows that people who think with models consistently outperform those who don't. And, moreover people who think with lots of models outperform people who use only one.
Why do models make us better thinkers?
Models help us to better organize information - to make sense of that fire hose or hairball of data (choose your metaphor) available on the Internet. Models improve our abilities to make accurate forecasts. They help us make better decisions and adopt more effective strategies. They even can improve our ability to design institutions and procedures. In this class, I present a starter kit of models: I start with models of tipping points. I move on to cover models explain the wisdom of crowds, models that show why some countries are rich and some are poor, and models that help unpack the strategic decisions of firm and politicians. The models covered in this class provide a foundation for future social science classes, whether they be in economics, political science, business, or sociology. Mastering this material will give you a huge leg up in advanced courses. They also help you in life.
Here's how the course will work.
For each model, I present a short, easily digestible overview lecture. Then, I'll dig deeper. I'll go into the technical details of the model. Those technical lectures won't require calculus but be prepared for some algebra. For all the lectures, I'll offer some questions and we'll have quizzes and even a final exam.

Title:  Computational Investing, Part I
Short desc:  Find out how modern electronic markets work, why stock prices change in the ways they do, and how computation can help our understanding of them.  Build algorithms and visualizations to inform investing practice.
Long desc:  <div><b>Overview<br></b>Why do the prices of some companies’ stocks seem to move up and down together while others move separately? What does portfolio “diversification” really mean and how important is it? What should the price of a stock be? How can we discover and exploit the relationships between equity prices automatically? We’ll examine these questions, and others, from a computational point of view. You will learn many of the principles and algorithms hedge funds and investment professionals use to maximize return and reduce risk in equity portfolios.<br></div><div><br><b>Topics</b></div>We start with a tour of the mathematics and statistics that underlie equity price changes, and the relationships between different groups of equities. We’ll review the most important economic theories of investing and how to create programs that take advantage of them.

Title:  Experimental Genome Science
Short desc:  Each of our cells contains nearly identical copies of our genome, which provides instructions that allow us to develop and function. This course serves as an introduction to the main laboratory and theoretical aspects of genomics and is divided into themes: genomes, genetics, functional genomics, systems biology, single cell approaches, proteomics, and applications.
Long desc:  <p>Each of our cells contains nearly identical copies of our genome, which provides instructions that allow us to develop and function. The field of Genomics focuses on the structure and function of genomes and plays a major and increasing role in both medicine and research. This course serves as an introduction to the main laboratory and theoretical aspects of genomics and is divided into themes: genomes, genetics, functional genomics, systems biology, single cell approaches, proteomics, and applications. We start with the basics, DNA sequencing and the genome project, then move to high throughput sequencing methods and applications. Next we introduce principles of genetics and then apply them in clinical genetics and other large-scale sequencing projects. In the functional genomics unit, we start with RNA expression dynamics, analysis of alternative splicing, epigenomics and ChIP-seq, and metagenomics. Model organisms and forward and reverse genetics screens are then discussed, along with quantitative trait locus (QTL) and eQTL analysis. After that, we introduce integrative and single cell genomics approaches and systems biology. Finally, we conclude by introducing in applying proteomic approaches.</p><div><br></div>

Title:  An Introduction to Operations Management
Short desc:  This course will teach you how to analyze and improve business processes, be it in services or in manufacturing. You will learn how to improve productivity, how to provide more choice to customers, how to reduce response times, and how to improve quality.
Long desc:  <p><b>PART OF THE WHARTON FOUNDATION SERIES</b>&nbsp;
</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Remember the last time you went to a restaurant. What did you expect from that restaurant? You wanted to find something on the menu that you liked, you wanted the meal to be prepared according to high quality standards, you wanted to get it quickly and
    didn’t want to pay too much money for it. Now, remember the last time you went to a doctor’s office or a hospital. What did you want the doctors and nurses to do? You wanted them to provide the right care for you, you wanted the care delivered with
    great quality, you wanted to get the care quickly, and you (or your insurance) didn’t want to pay too much for it.
    <br>
    <br>Put differently, the management skills that you need to run the operations of a restaurant are the same that you need to run a hospital. And these are the skills you will learn in this course. Specifically, you will learn how to improve productivity,
    increase responsiveness, provide more choice to the customer, and deliver higher quality standards. In short, you will learn how to analyze business processes and how to improve them. Along the way, you will learn about topics such as Lean Operations,
    Six Sigma, and the Toyota production system, you will hear about bottlenecks, flows rates, and inventory levels. And, much, much more.</p>

Title:  Design: Creation of Artifacts in Society
Short desc:  Combine fundamental concepts with hands-on design challenges to become a better designer.

Long desc:  This is a course aimed at making you a better designer. The course marries theory and practice, as both are valuable in improving design performance. Lectures and readings will lay out the fundamental concepts that underpin design as a human activity.
Weekly design challenges test your ability to apply those ideas to solve real problems. The course is deliberately broad - spanning all domains of design, including architecture, graphics, services, apparel, engineered goods, and products. The emphasis
of the course is the basic design process: define, explore, select, and refine. You, the student, bring to the course your particular interests and expertise related to, for instance, engineering, furniture, fashion, architecture, or products. In prior
sessions of the course about half of the participants were novices and about half had prior professional design expertise. Both groups seem to benefit substantially from the course. All project work is evaluated by your peers -- and indeed, you will also
be a peer reviewer. This format allows you to see an interesting collection of projects while getting useful feedback on your own project.
<br>
<br><b>Student Testimonials from Earlier Sessions of the Course:</b>
<br>
<span>"An amazing course - a joy to take. I will really miss checking in every
    week to see the latest. I learned a great deal, from the videos, [the course staff] and my fellow
    students. I think getting the feedback from my peers was such a great way
    to run the course. So many ideas, suggestions, thoughts and words of encouragement
    that were so appreciated. I've been driving everyone I know talking about it all the time." &nbsp;--E. Wadsworth-Jones
<br>
<br>"When I signed up for this course I didn't know what to expect; the experience
was so good and rewarding. I just loved it every step of the way. The course
was brilliant, challenging and fun! Our professor, Prof. Karl Ulrich, is
an amazing teacher, I loved his down to Earth approach.  Participating in a tournament was also one of the course's highlights. The whole thing was a great, unforgettable experience. I wish to thank with all my heart Coursera and the University of Pennsylvania for the opportunity given
to us."

Title:  Greek and Roman Mythology
Short desc:  This course will focus on the myths of ancient Greece and Rome, as a way of exploring the nature of myth and the function it plays for individuals, societies, and nations.
Long desc:  Myths are traditional stories that have endured over a long time. Some
of them have to do with events of great importance, such as the founding
of a nation. Others tell the stories of great heroes and heroines and their
exploits and courage in the face of adversity. Still others are simple
tales about otherwise unremarkable people who get into trouble or do some
great deed. What are we to make of all these tales, and why do people seem
to like to hear them? This course will focus on the myths of ancient Greece
and Rome, as a way of exploring the nature of myth and the function it
plays for individuals, societies, and nations. We will also pay some attention
to the way the Greeks and Romans themselves understood their own myths.
Are myths subtle codes that contain some universal truth? Are they a window
on the deep recesses of a particular culture? Are they a set of blinders
that all of us wear, though we do not realize it? Or are they just entertaining
stories that people like to tell over and over? This course will investigate
these questions through a variety of topics, including the creation of
the universe, the relationship between gods and mortals, human nature,
religion, the family, sex, love, madness, and death.

Title:  Networked Life
Short desc:  Networked Life will explore recent scientific efforts to explain social, economic and technological structures -- and the way these structures interact -- on many different scales, from the behavior of individuals or small groups to that of complex networks such as the Internet and the global economy.
Long desc:  <ul>
<li>What science underlies companies like Facebook, Twitter and Google?</li>
<li>How does your position in a social network (dis)advantage you?</li>
<li>What do game theory and the Paris subway have to do with Internet routing?</li>
<li>How might a social network influence election outcomes?</li>
<li>What are the economics of email spam?</li>
<li>How does Google find what you're looking for... and exactly how do they make money doing so?</li>
</ul>
<p>Networked Life looks at how our world is connected -- socially, strategically and technologically -- and why it matters.</p>
<p>The answers to the questions above are related. They have been the subject of a fascinating intersection of disciplines, including computer science, physics, psychology, sociology, mathematics, economics and finance. Researchers from these areas all strive to quantify and explain the growing complexity and connectivity of the world around us, and they have begun to develop a rich new science along the way.</p>
<p>Networked Life will explore recent scientific efforts to explain social, economic and technological structures -- and the way these structures interact -- on many different scales, from the behavior of individuals or small groups to that of complex networks such as the Internet and the global economy.</p>
<p>This course covers computer science topics and other material that is mathematical, but all material will be presented in a way that is accessible to an educated audience with or without a strong technical background. The majority of the course is grounded in scientific and mathematical findings of the past two decades or less (often much less).</p>
<p>Networked Life is the flagship course of the new <a href="http://www.nets.upenn.edu/" target="_blank">Networked and Social Systems Engineering</a> program at the University of Pennsylvania.</p>

Title:  An Introduction to Financial Accounting
Short desc:  This course will improve your fluency in financial accounting, the language of business.  You will learn how to read, understand, and analyze most of the information provided by companies in their financial statements.  These skills will help you make more informed decisions using financial information.
Long desc:  <p>Accounting is the language of business. Companies communicate their performance to outsiders and evaluate the performance of their employees using information generated by the accounting
    system.  Learning the language of accounting is essential for anyone that must make decisions based on financial information. <br></p>
<p>The course is designed to provide an understanding of financial accounting fundamentals for prospective users of corporate financial information, such as investors, creditors, employees, and other stakeholders (e.g., suppliers, customers).  
    The course focuses on understanding how economic events such as operating activities, corporate investments, and financing transactions are recorded in the three main financial statements (i.e., the income statement, balance sheet, and statement of
    cash flows). Students will develop the technical skills needed to analyze financial statements and disclosures for use in financial analysis.  Students will also learn how accounting standards and managerial incentives affect the financial reporting
    process.  </p>

Title:  Introduction to Mathematical Thinking
Short desc:  Learn how to think the way mathematicians do - a powerful cognitive process developed over thousands of years.
Long desc:  <div><b><i>NOTE: For the Winter 2014 session, the course website will go live at 10:00 AM US-PST on Saturday February 1, two days before the course begins, so you have time to familiarize yourself with the website structure, watch some short introductory videos, and look at some preliminary material.<br><br></i></b>The goal of the course is to help you develop a valuable mental ability – a powerful way of thinking that our ancestors have developed over three thousand years.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Mathematical thinking is not the same as doing mathematics – at least not as mathematics is typically presented in our school system. School math typically focuses on learning procedures to solve highly stereotyped problems. Professional mathematicians think a certain way to solve real problems, problems that can arise from the everyday world, or from science, or from within mathematics itself. The key to success in school math is to learn to think inside-the-box. In contrast, a key feature of mathematical thinking is thinking outside-the-box – a valuable ability in today’s world. This course helps to develop that crucial way of thinking.</div>
<div> <br>The course is offered in two versions. The eight-week-long Basic Course is designed for people who want to develop or improve mathematics-based, analytic thinking for professional or general life purposes. The ten-week-long Extended Course is aimed primarily at first-year students at college or university who are thinking of majoring in mathematics or a mathematically-dependent subject, or high school seniors who have such a college career in mind. The final two weeks are more intensive and require more mathematical background than the Basic Course. There is no need to make a formal election between the two. Simply skip or drop out of the final two weeks if you decide you want to complete only the Basic Course.</div><div><br><b>Subtitles for all video lectures available in</b>: Portuguese (provided by <a href="http://www.fundacaolemann.org.br/" target="_blank">The Lemann Foundation</a>), English<br></div>

Title:  Compilers
Short desc:  This course will discuss the major ideas used today in the implementation of programming language compilers. You will learn how a program written in a high-level language designed for humans is systematically translated into a program written in low-level assembly more suited to machines!
Long desc:  <p>This course will discuss the major ideas used today in the implementation of programming language compilers, including lexical analysis, parsing, syntax-directed translation, abstract syntax trees, types and type checking, intermediate languages, dataflow analysis, program optimization, code generation, and runtime systems. As a result, you will learn how a program written in a high-level language designed for humans is systematically translated into a program written in low-level assembly more suited to machines. Along the way we will also touch on how programming languages are designed, programming language semantics, and why there are so many different kinds of programming languages.</p>
<p>The course lectures will be presented in short videos. To help you master the material, there will be in-lecture questions to answer, quizzes, and two exams: a midterm and a final. There will also be homework in the form of exercises that ask you to show a sequence of logical steps needed to derive a specific result, such as the sequence of steps a type checker would perform to type check a piece of code, or the sequence of steps a parser would perform to parse an input string. This checking technology is the result of ongoing research at Stanford into developing innovative tools for education, and we're excited to be the first course ever to make it available to students.</p>
An optional course project is to write a complete compiler for COOL, the Classroom Object Oriented Language. COOL has the essential features of a realistic programming language, but is small and simple enough that it can be implemented in a few thousand lines of code. Students who choose to do the project can implement it in either C++ or Java.<br>I hope you enjoy the course!
<p><strong>Why Study Compilers?</strong></p>
Everything that computers do is the result of some program, and all of the millions of programs in the world are written in one of the many thousands of programming languages that have been developed over the last 60 years. Designing and implementing a programming language turns out to be difficult; some of the best minds in computer science have thought about the problems involved and contributed beautiful and deep results. Learning something about compilers will show you the interplay of theory and practice in computer science, especially how powerful general ideas combined with engineering insight can lead to practical solutions to very hard problems. Knowing how a compiler works will also make you a better programmer and increase your ability to learn new programming languages quickly.

Title:  Introduction to Classical Music
Short desc:  This course will focus on Western classical music of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries; it is designed for people who are passionate about classical music but who have not necessarily had any advanced training or taken any college-level music courses.  The only prerequisite is a basic knowledge of how to read musical notation.
Long desc:  This is a course for students who are passionate about classical music
and eager to learn more about it, but who have not necessarily had any
advanced technical training or taken any college-level music courses. The
only prerequisite is a basic knowledge of how to read musical notation.
Otherwise, no prior experience is needed; all concepts will be explained
in class, and musical terms will be defined as they arise. This course
will focus on Western classical music of the eighteenth and nineteenth
centuries, music that exemplifies tonality, the system of major and minor
keys, including pieces composed by Bach, Mozart, Beethoven, Schubert, Schumann,
Chopin, Wagner, Brahms, Richard Strauss, and others. This course will tell
two competing stories about tonal music and try to reconcile them. On one
hand, we will explore what all tonal pieces have in common, the shared
musical language that makes them intelligible and allows them to communicate;
on the other hand, we will try to discover what makes each piece unique,
how composers bend the common language to say something new. Although the
course will incorporate historical perspectives, it will not be a chronological
survey. Instead, it will combine music theory with aesthetics, balancing
principles of structural organization with insights into the aesthetic
meaning and effects of these principles. By illustrating his lectures with
his own performances at the keyboard, Professor Korsyn will bring the music
to life.

Title:  Fantasy and Science Fiction: The Human Mind, Our Modern World
Short desc:  We understand the world — and our selves — through stories. Then some of those hopes and fears become the world.
Long desc:  Fantasy is a key term both in psychology and in the art and artifice of
humanity. The things we make, including our stories, reflect, serve, and
often shape our needs and desires. We see this everywhere from fairy tale
to kiddie lit to myth; from "Cinderella" to <i>Alice in Wonderland </i>to <i>Superman</i>;
from building a fort as a child to building ideal, planned cities as whole
societies. Fantasy in ways both entertaining and practical serves our persistent
needs and desires and illuminates the human mind. Fantasy expresses itself
in many ways, from the comfort we feel in the godlike powers of a fairy
godmother to the seductive unease we feel confronting Dracula. From a practical
viewpoint, of all the fictional forms that fantasy takes, science fiction,
from <i>Frankenstein</i> to <i>Avatar</i>, is the most important in our modern
world because it is the only kind that explicitly recognizes the profound
ways in which science and technology, those key products of the human mind,
shape not only our world but our very hopes and fears. This course will
explore Fantasy in general and Science Fiction in specific both as art
and as insights into ourselves and our world.

Title:  Calvin - Histoire et réception d'une Réforme
Short desc:  Course in French with English subtitles --

Ce cours introduit à la vie et à la pensée du réformateur Jean Calvin (1509-1564) ainsi qu’à son influence sur le monde moderne et contemporain. La démarche proposée se veut critique, il ne s’agit ni de canoniser ni de condamner Calvin, mais de comprendre sa pensée avec toute la distance requise et d’en analyser les enjeux.
--
This course is an introduction to the life and thought of the reformer John Calvin (1509-1564) and to his influence on the modern and contemporary world. The approach we develop is critical:  we intend neither to canonize nor to condemn Calvin or his thought. Our goal, rather, is to avoid any rash evaluation in order to understand his thought and analyze the issues at stake in it.
Long desc:  Qui était Jean Calvin ? Pourquoi ses idées ont-elles exercé une telle
influence au 16e siècle et dans les siècles suivants ? Ce cours cherchera
à répondre à ces deux questions.
<br>Il mettra en évidence l’humanisme de Calvin, sa compréhension de la pensée
biblique, son acuité théologique, son sens aigu des problèmes sociaux et
politiques. Nous aurons aussi l’occasion d’évoquer l’apport de Calvin à
la culture (notamment à la langue française, qui lui doit considérablement)
et à la conception de l’humain devant Dieu et dans la société. Nous verrons
également comment Calvin fit de Genève la capitale d’une idée et d’un idéal
de vie chrétienne, en pensant le rapport au travail et à l’argent ou en
créant des institutions comme la Compagnie des pasteurs, le Consistoire
et l’Académie.
<br>Ce cours mettra également en évidence la place que Calvin occupe dans
l’histoire de la tolérance, ou plutôt de l’intolérance, religieuse :
l’affaire Servet (du nom de ce savant espagnol condamné à mort à Genève
pour hérésie) fera ainsi l’objet d’une analyse spécifique. Nous tenterons
également de montrer les apports de la théologie de Calvin (notamment la
compréhension renouvelée d’un Dieu en qui l’humain peut faire confiance)
et ses limites (par exemple la doctrine dite de la prédestination).
<br>Ce cours d’introduction fera également une place à l’histoire du calvinisme
en Europe (France, Allemagne, Provinces-Unies, Angleterre) et dans le monde
(Amérique, Afrique du Sud, Asie).
<br><i>Le cours est donné en français avec sous-titres en anglais.<br>---<br></i>Who
was John Calvin? Why were his ideas so influential in the 16th century
and well beyond his time? This course seeks to answer these two questions.
<br>We will present his humanistic leanings, his interpretation of the Bible,
his theological vision, his acute sense of social and political questions.
We will consider his contribution to culture, how he contributed to shaping
French language, his understanding of the human before God and in society.
The course will address how Calvin sought to transform the city of Geneva
into an idea and an ideal of Christian life, by thinking the meaning of
work and money, but also by creating educational and ecclesiastical institutions
(the « Company of Pastors », the « Consistory » and
the « Academy »).
<br>The course will locate Calvin within the history of religious toleration,
or rather of religious intolerance. We will analyse the fate of Michel
Servet, a learned Spanish man who was condemned for heresy and executed
in Geneva in 1553. With regard to Calvin’s theology, we will show both
his lasting contribution (especially his understanding of a God in whom
one may trust) as well as the limitations of his thought (for instance
his doctrine of predestination).
<br>Towards the end of this introductory course, we will turn our attention
to the history of Calvinism in Europe (France, Germany, the United Provinces,
England) and in various parts of the world (Americas, South Africa and
Asia).

Title:  Computational Molecular Evolution
Short desc:  In this course you will learn about how and why DNA and protein sequences evolve. You will learn the theory behind methods for building and analyzing phylogenetic trees, and get hands-on experience with some widely used software packages.

Long desc:  <div>This course is about molecular evolution - the evolution of DNA, RNA, and protein molecules. The focus is on computational methods for inferring phylogenetic trees from sequence data, and the course will give an introduction to the fundamental theory and algorithms, while also giving the student hands-on experience with some widely used software tools. Since evolutionary theory is the conceptual foundation of biology (in the words of Theodosius Dobzhansky: "Nothing in biology makes sense except in the light of evolution"), what you learn on this course will be relevant for any project you will ever do inside the life sciences. A phylogenetic tree will almost always help you think more clearly about your biological problem. </div><div><br></div><div>A special emphasis is put on methods that employ explicit models of the evolutionary process (maximum likelihood and Bayesian approaches), and we will explore the role of statistical modeling in molecular evolution, and in science more generally. A mathematical (statistical) model of a biological system can be considered to be a stringently phrased hypothesis about that system, and this way of thinking about models will often be helpful. In addition to model-based methods, you will also learn about other approaches, such as those based on parsimony and genetic distance (<i>e.g.</i>, neighbor joining). </div><div><br></div><div>Often, the evolutionary tree is the result we are interested in - knowing how a set of sequences (or organisms) are related can provide us with important information about the biological problem we are  investigating. For instance, knowing which organisms are most closely related to a newly identified, uncharacterized, pathogenic bacterium will allow you to infer many aspects of its lifestyle, thereby giving you important clues about how to fight it. In other cases, however, inferring the structure of the tree is not the goal: for instance, our main focus may instead be the detection of positions in a protein undergoing positive selection (indicating adaptation) or negative selection (indicating conserved functional importance). However, even in these cases, the underlying phylogenetic tree <i>will</i> be an important part of our hypothesis about (model of) how the proteins have been evolving, and will help in getting the correct answer. </div><div><br></div><div>Although the study of molecular evolution does require a certain level of mathematical understanding, this course has been designed to be accessible also for students with limited computational background (e.g., students of biology).</div><div><br></div><div>Topics covered:<br><br></div><ul><li>Brief introduction to evolutionary theory and population genetics.</li><li>Mechanisms of molecular evolution.</li><li>Models of substitution.</li><li>Reconstruction of phylogenetic trees using parsimony, distance based methods, maximum likelihood, and Bayesian techniques.</li><li>Advanced models of nucleotide substitution (gamma-distributed mutation rates, codon models and analysis of selective pressure).</li><li>Statistical analysis of biological hypotheses (likelihood ratio tests, Akaike Information Criterion, Bayesian statistics).</li></ul><div><br></div>

Title:  Astrobiology and the Search for Extraterrestrial Life
Short desc:  Learn about the origin and evolution of life and the search for life beyond the Earth.
Long desc:  Over two thousand years ago, the ancient Greeks wondered if there were other worlds in the cosmos. This question is now being experimentally tested. This course, offered by the UK Centre for Astrobiology at the University of Edinburgh,&nbsp;is an introduction to astrobiology and was the first MOOC to explore this subject. It explores the origin and evolution of life on the Earth and its potential to exist elsewhere. <br><br>Astrobiology addresses compelling questions of wide interest such as: How did life originate on the Earth? Is this an inevitable process and is life common across the Universe? Astrobiology is an interdisciplinary science that bridges fields as diverse as astrophysics, biology, geosciences and chemistry. <br><br> In this course we will explore what we know about life’s ability to live in extreme environments on the Earth, we will look at different hypotheses for how it originated. We will look at some of the missions to search for life in our own Solar System and on planets orbiting distant stars. We will discuss some of the extreme environments on the Earth that help us understand the limits of life and how life has adapted to cope with extremes. We will explore the possibility of intelligent alien life and some of the implications of its detection. The course will provide a foundation in astrobiology and introduce students to concepts in a diversity of scientific fields.

Title:  The Role of the Renminbi in the International Monetary System 
Short desc:  This course will discuss various aspects of the Renminbi internationalization, including the reform of the international monetary system, the opportunities and challenges to internationalize the Renminbi, the evolution of China's monetary and exchange rate policies, and the implications of the Renminbi internationalization for Hong Kong.
Long desc:  <p>The current international
monetary system has critical defects. An effective reform of the system calls
for a new international currency, for which the Renminbi may be a promising
candidate. Despite the rapid growth of the Chinese economy, certain prerequisites
have to be satisfied before the Renminbi can be internationalized. China needs
to ensure full convertibility of the Renminbi and further develop its financial
markets to facilitate the process of internationalization.</p>

<p>This course will discuss various
aspects of the Renminbi internationalization. Specifically, innovative
suggestions will be provided on topics including the reform of the
international monetary system, the opportunities and challenges of the Renminbi
internationalization, and the evolution of China’s monetary and exchange rate
policies. Since the internationalization of Renminbi is important to the future
of Hong Kong as an international financial center, the lectures will also
discuss the possible implications of this process for Hong Kong.</p>

Title:  Statistics One
Short desc:  Statistics One is a comprehensive yet friendly introduction to statistics.
Long desc:  <p>Statistics One is designed to be a comprehensive yet friendly introduction
    to fundamental concepts in statistics. Comprehensive means that this course
    provides a solid foundation for students planning to pursue more advanced
    courses in statistics. Friendly means exactly that. The course assumes
    very little background knowledge in statistics and introduces new concepts
    with several fun and easy to understand examples. </p>
<p>This course is, quite literally, for everyone. If you think you can't
    learn statistics, this course is for you. If you had a statistics course
    before but feel like you need a refresher, this course is for you. Even
    if you are a relatively advanced researcher or analyst, this course provides
    a foundation and a context that helps to put one’s work into perspective.</p>
<p>Statistics One also provides an introduction to the R programming language.
    All the examples and assignments will involve writing code in R and interpreting
    R output. R software is free! What this means is you can download R, take
    this course, and start programming in R after just a few lectures. That
    said, this course is not a comprehensive guide to R or to programming in
    general. </p>

Title:  Global Health: An Interdisciplinary Overview
Short desc:  This course proposes an overview of current global health challenges drawing on the insights of several academic disciplines including medicine, public health, law, economics, social sciences and humanities. This interdisciplinary approach will guide the student into seven critical topics in global health.
Long desc:  Course coordinators: Prof. Antoine Geissbuhler, MD, Prof. Louis Loutan,
MD, Dr Slim Slama, MD and Dr Didier Wernli, MD, MA
<br>Course director: Dr Samantha Battams, PhD<br>Course assistant: Dr Rafael Ruiz de Castaneda, PhD
<br>
<br>Our globalised world has posed new challenges for global health. Infectious diseases have the potential to travel quickly and spread widely
across countries (e.g. due to increased international travel). The determinants of health (such as the food system) are across country borders, leading to a growing burden in non-communicable diseases in both developed and developing countries. Issues
in traditionally non health sectors such as climate change or trade
can have dramatic and worldwide effects on health and health systems.
<br>
<br>These short examples illustrate what Global Health is about:&nbsp; issues
that not only cross national boundaries but also disciplinary territories.
In our interdependent world, more and more health issues cannot be addressed
by a country nor by a sector alone and require collaboration, coordination
and integration.
<br><br>The course will draw from academic personnel working across disciplines and the 
wider community in international Geneva (e.g. international 
organisations, NGOs). It will utilise an ecological or 'systems' perspective, along with a social determinants and human rights approach to health.<br>

Title:  Design Thinking for Business Innovation
Short desc:  This course will provide an overview of the process and tools used for design thinking, and examine their application in organizational situations.


Long desc:  Design thinking is a popular new idea in the business world - organizations as diverse as entrepreneurial start-ups, big established corporations, and government and social service organizations are experimenting with design thinking as an alternative
approach to traditional problem-solving. Accelerated by the spectacular rise of <a href="http://goo.gl/9HryvA" target="_blank">Apple</a> and <a href="http://goo.gl/N11yoS" target="_blank" title="Link: http://goo.gl/N11yoS">IDEO</a>, design thinking is seen as offering a new approach better suited for dealing with the accelerating pressures for growth and innovation faced by so many organizations
today. But design thinking can remain mysterious for people interested in introducing this approach into their decision-making processes. Demystifying it is the focus of this course.

<p><span>Though <i>designing</i> as a
craft requires years of dedicated education and talent to master, <i>design thinking</i>, as a problem solving
approach, does not. In this course, we work with the following model that
contains four </span>questions and ten tools:</p>





<div>
    <img src="https://coursera-topic-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/27/12e27d2216ba70fd7089556c788733/design_business.jpg" title="Image: https://coursera-topic-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/27/12e27d2216ba70fd7089556c788733/design_business.jpg">
    <br><span>The four sequential questions that take us on a journey through an
assessment of current reality <i>(What is?),</i>
the envisioning of a new future (<i>What
if?),</i> the development of some concepts for new-business opportunities (<i>What wows?</i>), and the testing of some of
those in the marketplace (<i>What works?</i>).
</span>The process of design thinking begins with data gathering: at the outset of the design process, designers gather a great deal of data on the users they want to create value for.  They mostly do this through ethnographic methods like experience
    mapping, rather than traditional methods like focus groups and surveys. Farther along in the process, designers make their new ideas concrete (in the form of prototypes) and go out and get better data from the real world in a process that is hypothesis-driven.
    That is, they treat their new ideas as hypotheses to be tested. They surface the assumptions underlying their hypotheses and test them – usually looking for the kind of behavioral metrics that will allow them to iterate their way to improved value
    propositions.</div>

<p>Accompanying the four questions is a set of new tools to help business people achieve the same kind of disciplined approach to innovation and growth that they bring to the rest of their business. In this course, we will look at the stories of a wide variety
    of organizations - major corporations like <b><a href="http://goo.gl/5yTYks" target="_blank" title="Link: http://goo.gl/5yTYks">IBM</a></b>, entrepreneurial start-ups like <b><a href="http://goo.gl/2NhoYR" target="_blank" title="Link: http://goo.gl/2NhoYR">MeYouHealth</a></b>, and even social service organizations like <b><a href="http://goo.gl/ZPI3D3" target="_blank " title="Link: http://goo.gl/ZPI3D3">The Good Kitchen</a></b> -
    all using the design thinking tools and approach to achieve better outcomes.</p>

Title:  Structural Equation Model and its Applications | 结构方程模型及其应用
Short desc:  在社会学、心理学、教育学、经济学、管理学、市场学等研究领域的数据分析中，结构方程建模是当前最前沿的统计方法中应用最广、研究最多的一个。它包含了方差分析、回归分析、路径分析和因子分析，弥补了传统回归分析和因子分析的不足，可以分析多因多果的联系、潜变量的关系，还可以处理多水平数据和纵向数据，是非常重要的多元数据分析工具。本课程系统地介绍结构方程模型和LISREL软件的应用，内容包括：结构方程分析（包括验证性因子分析）的基本概念、统计原理、在社会科学研究中的应用、常用模型及其LISREL程序、结果的解释和模型评价。学员应具备基本的统计知识（如：标准差、t-检验、相关系数），理解回归分析和因子分析的概念。 注：本课程配套教材为《结构方程模型及其应用》（以LISREL软件为例）。
Long desc:  自 1995十多年以来，我已在大陆不同地方，举办近百次大型结构方程研习班。大陆学生勤奋、进取的学习态度，令我甚为感动。不过，中国地域甚为广阔， 就算我到一些偏远地方辦免費班，頗多学生仍难以支付旅费前往参加研习班。为此，我将在香港中文大学内自行制作的网上课程公开，方便学生们用這网上課程及大量的練習去修读。課程內容著重理論的解釋及應用，適合使用LISREL及其他輭件者選讀。
<br><br>Since 1995, I have conducted close to a hundred large-scale structural equation workshops and am moved by Mainland Chinese students’ diligence and eagerness to learn.  However, China is geographically too large.  Even if I conduct free workshops at remote cities, a lot of students still cannot pay for the travel expenses to attend.  Therefore, I am now making publicly available an original web course that is used by our own students. I hope all Chinese students can now enjoy this course with plenty of exercises to monitor their learning. As most of the course content concentrates on the explanation and applications of theories, the course should be useful for students who intend to use LISREL or other software.

Title:  Epidemics - the Dynamics of Infectious Diseases
Short desc:  Malaria, HIV/AIDS, Influenza, Measles - we’re in a constant battle against infectious diseases. This is a course about the dynamics of such diseases  - how they emerge, how they spread around the globe, and how they can best be controlled.
Long desc:  <div>Not so long ago, it was almost guaranteed that you would die of an infectious disease. In fact, had you been born just 150 years ago, your chances of dying of an infectious disease before you've reached the tender age of 5 would have been extremely high. </div><div> </div><div>Since then, science has come a long way in understanding infectious diseases - what they are, how they spread, and how they can be prevented. But diseases like HIV/AIDS, Malaria, Tuberculosis, or the flu are still major killers worldwide, and novel emerging diseases are a constant threat to public health. In addition, the bugs are evolving. Antibiotics, our most potent weapon against bacterial infections, are losing their power because the bacteria are becoming resistant. In this course, we'll explore the major themes of infectious diseases dynamics.<br><br>After we’ve covered the basics, we'll be looking at the dynamics of the flu, and why we're worried about flu pandemics. We'll be looking at the dynamics of childhood diseases such as measles and whooping cough, which were once considered almost eradicated, but are now making a comeback. We'll explore Malaria, and use it as a case study of the evolution of drug resistance. We'll even be looking at social networks - how diseases can spread from you to your friends to your friends' friends, and so on. And of course we’ll be talking about vaccination too. We’ll also be talking about how mobile phones, social media and crowdsourcing are revolutionizing disease surveillance, giving rise to a new field of digital epidemiology. And yes, we will be talking about Zombies - not human zombies, but zombie ants whose brains are hijacked by an infectious fungus. <br><br>And there's one more thing: during the course, we'll be running a massive online epidemic with you, the participants - virtually, of course. You can signup for this epidemic game online, at <a href="http://www.moocdemic.com" title="Link: http://www.moocdemic.com">www.moocdemic.com</a>. <br><br>We're looking forward to having you join us for an exciting course!<br></div>

<p dir="ltr">Learning mathematics at university is fundamentally different than learning mathematics at high school. This difference has many manifestations: at high school most of the
learning focuses on the development of technical skills, and the tendency is to
draw a clear separation between the various areas of mathematics. In contrast,
the mathematics taught at university level deals to a large extent with
mathematical structures and their interconnections.</p>

<p dir="ltr">This course is a "display
window" of the mathematics that is being taught and studied at the
university. Its main goal is to prepare would-be-students toward the mathematics
that they will encounter, whether they choose to learn this subject, or any
discipline that uses mathematics as its main language and tool (e.g., physics,
computer science, and engineering).</p>

<p dir="ltr">Most of the mathematical content
covered in this course is part of the high school curriculum. The difference is
in the approach. In these lectures we will emphasize central mathematical
concepts (e.g. the need to define ambiguous terms, and the principle
of mathematical deduction). In particular, we will distinguish between
deduction based on intuitive arguments and deduction based on rigorous
reasoning. Moreover, we will demonstrate how seemingly distinct subjects merge
to form the depth and beauty that are at the heart of the mathematical science.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><blockquote><p></p></blockquote>

Title:  Human Evolution: Past and Future
Short desc:  Introduction to the science of human origins, the fossil and archaeological record, and genetic ancestry of living and ancient human populations. The course emphasizes the ways our evolution touches our lives, including health and diet, and explores how deep history may shape the future of our species.
Long desc:  <div>This course covers our evolutionary history across more than seven million years, from our origins among the apes up to the biological changes that are still unfolding today. If you enroll, you'll encounter the evidence for the earliest members of our lineage, as they begin the long pathway to humanity. You'll see how scientists are learning about the diets of ancient people, using microscopic evidence and chemical signatures in ancient teeth. We will explore together the exciting fossil discoveries of the last ten years, which have shaken up our notions of the origin of human culture and our own genus. <br><br>Genomics has fundamentally transformed the way we understand our evolution, in many ways opening the direct evidence of our history to anyone. The course will teach you how to look inside the genomes of humans, Neandertals and other ancient people.  If you have used personal genomics to get your own genotypes, the course will guide you in connecting genetics to your ancestry among ancient humans.<br><br>The course brings a special focus on the rapid evolutionary changes of the last 10,000 years. You'll learn about the consequences of our shift to agriculture, and the ways that people of industrialized nations are still changing today. At the end, we trek forward to anticipate what evolutionary changes may be in store for humanity in the future, using our knowledge of history and scientific understanding to inform our speculations.</div>

Title:  Programmed cell death
Short desc:  Billions of cells in the body die every day. How and why do these cells die? If you want to know the answers to these questions and if you also would like to know how scientists figured them out, this course might interest you.
Long desc:  <p>In this
course, you will learn about the conserved, molecular machinery that eliminates
cells through programmed cell death type I, also referred to as ‘apoptosis’.
Through apoptosis many cells are eliminated from our body during development
and throughout adult life, and deregulated apoptosis can lead to various
diseases such as cancer and auto-immune diseases. Rather than just telling you
about the molecular machinery of apoptosis and how it works to kill cells, I
will walk you through and discuss with you the critical experiments that led to
the discovery of the key components of this molecular machinery and the
mechanisms through which they function.&nbsp;I will also
discuss how apoptosis research can help to develop novel&nbsp;therapeutics
and consider the questions that remain open in
the field.</p><p>The course
will cover the following topics:</p>

<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Introduction
to programmed cell death and apoptosis</p>

<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The
BCL-2 family of proteins</p>

<p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Apaf

Title:  An Introduction to Global Health
Short desc:  This course will provide you with an overview of the most important health challenges facing the world today. You will gain insight into how challenges have changed over time, we will discuss the likely determinants of such changes and examine future projections. Successful international strategies and programs promoting human health will be highlighted and global health governance structures will be mapped and the role of the key actors explored.
Long desc:  The course takes its starting point in the belief that good health is intimately linked with personal happiness, productivity, the economic and social development of nations and the advancement of people. <br><br>Globalization processes influence the health of individuals, societies and the function of health systems in many ways and may present opportunities but may also pose a risk to vulnerable societies. Throughout this course presentations will transcend the perspectives of individual countries and will critically discuss how global mega-trends and different sectors of society influence the health of population. Transition in health and the drivers of such transition will be core elements of this course.&nbsp; <br><br>During the six course weeks we will explore a range of themes, including: communicable and non-communicable diseases, environmental health, child health, reproductive health and rights, and health among refugees and displaced populations. We focus on the dual burden of communicable and non-communicable disease experienced by much of the world’s population today.<br><br>As the deadline for meeting the Millennium Development Goals (MDG’s) nears, course participants will also reflect on the post-MDG agenda by exploring the future of global health and trends in technical innovation, global strategies and programs in the fight for better health. Through lectures, readings, and assignments, course participants will be asked to think critically about the health of the world’s population and to reflect on overcoming the challenges of achieving good health around the world. <br>

Title:  Statistical Molecular Thermodynamics
Short desc:  This introductory physical chemistry course examines the connections between molecular properties and the behavior of macroscopic chemical systems.
Long desc:  <p>Statistical Molecular Thermodynamics is a course in physical chemistry
that relates the microscopic properties of molecules to the macroscopic behavior
of chemical systems. Quantized molecular energy levels and their use in the
construction of molecular and ensemble partition functions is described.
Thermodynamic state functions, their dependence on the partition function, and
their relationships with one another (as dictated by the three Laws of
Thermodynamics) are all examined in detail. Analysis and demonstration takes
place primarily in the context of ideal and real gases. This eight-week course
covers slightly more than half of a typical semester-long course in chemical
thermodynamics. Typical topics to be addressed subsequently would be phase
equilibria, liquids, solutions of non-electrolytes and electrolytes, and
chemical reaction equilibria. <br></p><p>Students
 who successfully complete the course will be able to predict how 
changes in molecular properties will influence the macroscopic behavior 
of those substances; they will understand the relationships between 
energy, heat, and work, and be able to predict how much work can be 
extracted from a given chemical process under various sets of 
conditions; they will understand the role of entropy in physical and 
chemical processes; and they will be able to engineer conditions to make
 chemical reactions spontaneously favorable (or not). Students will also
 become adept with differential calculus as a tool to derive and 
manipulate relationships between connected thermodynamic variables and 
state functions.<br></p>

Title:  Competitive Strategy
Short desc:  In this six-modules course you will learn how firms behave in situations in which strategic decisions are interdependent, i.e. where my actions affect my competitors' profits and vice versa. Using the basic tools of game theory, we will analyze how firms choose strategies to attain competitive advantage. 
Long desc:  <p>This course
is about the behavior of companies in
competitive markets. Facing competition forces firms to look ahead and
anticipate developments: If my rivals are likely
to react to a price cut, I will have to take the expected reaction into account.
We focus on such instances of “strategic
interdependencies” in real business situations. <br></p><p>We will first study the basic concepts of game theory as a toolbox with which we will
then analyze strategic “games” in real-life settings. Rather than a set
of checklists of “how-to-behave” in a number of
prespecified situations, this course will teach you to think about business
strategy in a systematic and exciting - and
ultimately more successful - way!</p>

We will use our toolbox to
address and analyze different decisions firms take: How do price wars happen and when do they end? When should I
enter a market in which firms currently make high profits? What makes strategic
partnerships work? These are just some examples of the questions we will
discuss during the course. By the end of the course, you should be able to
apply the concepts to pretty much any business situation.<br><br>This course is complemented by <a target="_blank" href="https://www.coursera.org/course/advcompstrategy">Advanced Competitive Strategy</a>.<br>

Title:  Scandinavian Film and Television
Short desc:  In many ways Scandinavian film and television is a global cultural brand, connected with and exporting some of the cultural and social values connected to a liberal and progressive welfare society. This course deals with the social, institutional and cultural background of film and television in Scandinavia and in a broader European and global context. 
Long desc:  <p>Scandinavia is well known internationally
for its welfare society, and part of this welfare society is a very developed
cultural policy based on both the free market and public support. Scandinavia
has a strong film and television culture with institutions and traditions
created to secure creative diversity for both national, Scandinavian and global
audiences. In many ways Scandinavian film and television is a global cultural
brand, connected with and exporting some of the cultural and social values
connected to a liberal and progressive welfare society. Dating back to the
silent cinema era and through the birth of a modern film and television culture
after 1945 Scandinavia has contributed significantly to our global cultural
heritage. </p>



<p><span>This course in <i>Scandinavian Film and Television</i> deals with the social,
institutional and cultural background of film and television in Scandinavia and
in a broader European and global context. The course will offer a deeper
understanding of the creative forces behind film and television, of how
Scandinavian society and culture has influenced the production. The course will
deal with the co-production in Scandinavia and the role of Scandinavian film
and television internationally. Theoretically the course will deal with
national and global cinema, with film and media sociology, with genre and
auteur theory and with film and media policy.</span></p>



<p><span>The course will also deal with some of the
most important film directors and film and television genres and the way they
have reflected and influenced our understanding of Scandinavia and the image of
Scandinavian culture and society abroad. From Carl Th. Dreyer’s complex
historical and religious dramas, Ingmar Bergman’s symbolic and psychological
films to the modern cinema of Lars von Trier, Aki Kaurismäki, Lukas Moodyson
and Bent Hamer - all important Scandinavian names in a broader European art
cinema tradition.  The course will deal
with typical examples of other and more popular genres in Scandinavian cinema
and modern, Scandinavian television drama and with aspects of the Scandinavian
documentary tradition. Examples include Jan Troell’s epic serial <i>The Immigrants/The New Land </i>(1971-72), global,
prize winning drama series like <i>The
Killing</i> (2007-12) and <i>Borgen</i> (2010-)
and international film blockbusters such as the Stieg Larson trilogy.</span></p>

Title:  Diabetes - a Global Challenge
Short desc:  Diabetes is a growing health problem in rich and poor countries alike. With this course you will get updated on cutting-edge diabetes research including biological, genetic and clinical aspects as well as prevention and epidemiology of diabetes. All provided by high-profile scientists from one the world's leading universities in diabetes research.
Long desc:  <p>Obesity is a common disorder, and in the United
States and many other western countries more than half of the populations are
overweight or obese. The prevalence is increasing dramatically, and the number
of obese individuals worldwide is now projected to reach as much as 1.1 billion
by 2030. Along with the increasing numbers of obese people, the prevalence of
type-2 diabetes is increasing tremendously worldwide due to the westernized
lifestyle. However, the sensitivity of the individual to a westernized
lifestyle and development of diabetes appears to be much dependent on his or
her genetic risk factors.
</p>
<p>As diabetes is
associated with a high rate of morbidity and mortality, and thereby accounts
for a large part of the public health care expenses, there is a great interest
in diabetes research to improve knowledge, prevention and treatment of diabetes.</p><p>This diabetes course will give you the newest state of the art updates on diabetes research in the fields of clinical aspects of diabetes and regulation of insulin
secretion, epidemiology of diabetes, heritability of diabetes, genetic aspects
of diabetes, prevention of diabetes and insulin resistance, molecular insulin
resistance, cellular aspects of diabetes, physiological regulation of blood
glucose, type 1 diabetes and stem cell research in diabetes.
</p>
<p>Each section will be covered
by world leading professors in the specific areas:</p><ul><li>Prof Thorkild Sørensen (Epidemiology of Diabetes and obesity)</li><li>Prof Jens Juul Holst (Physiological regulation of blood glucose)</li><li>Prof Allan Vaag (Pathophysiology of Diabetes and Genetic versus pre- and post natal aetiological factors in T2D)&nbsp;</li><li>Prof Thomas Mandrup (Inflammatory beta-cell destruction in diabetes)</li><li>Prof Torben Hansen (Genetic aspects of Diabetes)</li><li>Prof Bente Stallknecht (Physical activity and its influence on insulin resistance and diabetes)</li><li>Prof Ole Madsen (Stem cell based therapy of Diabetes) <br></li></ul><br>

Title:  Physique générale - mécanique
Short desc:  À l’École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne, un cours de physique générale fait partie de la formation de tous les futurs ingénieurs et scientifiques. Le présent cours de mécanique en fait partie. Il a pour but de leur apprendre à transcrire sous forme mathématique un phénomène physique, afin de pouvoir en formuler une analyse raisonnée.
Long desc:  <p>La mécanique classique est l’un
des piliers d’une formation polytechnique car elle permet de développer un
savoir-faire en traitant une variété de problèmes du point matériel et du
solide indéformable. On aborde les sujets classiques de la mécanique, comme le
phénomène de résonance, la balistique, le mouvement des planètes autour du
Soleil, et les effets associés aux référentiels accélérés. On cherche à
développer l’habitude de discerner&nbsp; les
limites des modèles&nbsp; qu’on utilise. Dans
cet esprit, on examinera aussi quels étaient les problèmes conceptuels qui ont
conduit à la théorie de la relativité restreinte.</p>

<p>L’accent sera mis sur la
méthodologie&nbsp;: l’étudiant apprendra à traiter rigoureusement un problème
donné, en choisissant judicieusement repère et référentiel et en appliquant la
ou les lois physiques adéquates afin d’obtenir les équations du mouvement.
Puis, il sera amené à discuter ces équations afin d’en tirer une solution
qualitative et/ou quantitative.</p><p></p><p>

</p><p><b>Attention</b> <b>:</b> le cours sera donné en deux sessions
parallèles. L'une aura un rythme particulièrement soutenu de deux leçons par
semaine pendant 12 semaines et correspond au rythme du cours de Physique
Générale I pour physiciens donné à l'EPFL.</p>

<p>Le rythme de la seconde session sera d'une leçon par semaine
pendant 24 semaines, correspondant ainsi à la cadence du cours de Physique
Générale pour les filières d'ingénieurs de l'EPFL. Cependant, cette seconde
session sera mise en pause durant les 8 semaines d'arrêt des cours entre le
semestre d'automne et celui de printemps, à savoir entre le 20 décembre 2013 et
le 17 février 2014.</p>

<p>Pour résumer, la session de 12 semaines (<i>rythme soutenu</i>)
commencera le vendredi 13 septembre et se terminera le 6 décembre. La session
de 24 semaines (<i>rythme normal</i>) commencera également le vendredi 13 septembre,
mais se terminera le 25 avril, avec 8 semaines de pause entre les leçons 14 et
15.</p>

Course ID:  970599
Title:  Social Epidemiology
Short desc:  Social epidemiology is about how a society makes people sick and/or healthy. We address not only the identification of new disease risk factors (e.g., deficient social capital) but also how well-known exposures (e.g., cigarette smoking, lead paint, health insurance) emerge and are maintained by the social system.
Long desc:  This course is about understanding the determinants of health from a broad
perspective. We focus on how social relationships and institutions -- such
as familial relationships, national policies, and global economic forces
-- promote or undermine the health of populations. The course covers existing
evidence of health disparities, research methods, and theories relevant
to the topic.
<br>
<br>The course is interesting because it reveals the so-called fundamental
causes of disease and health disparities recognizable within social groups.
For example, we examine why a flu germ can affect whole groups of people
differently. In short, the course challenges the notion that health is
a narrowly defined medical problem.
<br>
<br>Students in the course will listen to lectures, read provided materials,
and complete quizzes and tests that examine comprehension and one's ability
to synthesize ideas.
<br>
<br><span>Upon completion of the course students should:<br></span>

<ul>
    <li>have a deep appreciation for how social arrangements impact the health
        of populations,</li>
    <li>be able to critically evaluate the scientific and popular health literature
        that address the causes of disease,</li>
    <li>be able to measure key social drivers such as race and socioeconomic status,
        and&nbsp;</li>
    <li>be able to conceive of research strategies that can answer questions critical
        for policy making.</li>

Course ID:  970600
Title:  Søren Kierkegaard - Subjectivity, Irony and the Crisis of Modernity
Short desc:  In this course we will explore how Kierkegaard deals with the problems associated with relativism, the lack of meaning and the undermining of religious faith that are typical of modern life. His penetrating analyses are still highly relevant today and have been seen as insightful for the leading figures of Existentialism, Post-Structuralism and Post-Modernism.

Long desc:  <p><i><b></b></i>It is often claimed that relativism, subjectivism and nihilism are typically
    modern philosophical problems that emerge with the breakdown of traditional
    values, customs and ways of life. The result is the absence of meaning,
    the lapse of religious faith, and feeling of alienation that is so widespread
    in modernity.
    <br>
</p>
<p>The Danish thinker Søren Kierkegaard (1813-55) gave one of the most penetrating
    analyses of this complex phenomenon of modernity. But somewhat surprisingly he seeks
    insight into it not in any modern thinker but rather in an ancient one,
    the Greek philosopher Socrates.</p>

Title:  Origins - Formation of the Universe, Solar System, Earth and Life
Short desc:  The Origins course tracks the origin of all things – from the Big Bang to the origin of the Solar System and the Earth. The course follows the evolution of life on our planet through deep geological time to present life forms.
Long desc:  <p>The history
of our planet and Solar System, during an interval of almost 5 billion years, is
controlled by a series of key biological and geological processes. The course
will investigate the prehistory and origins of our Solar System, the Earth and
its tectonic processes, the origin of life and the evolution of the complex
marine and terrestrial ecosystems that have uniquely defined our planet.</p>

<p>The course
is taught by a broad range of specialists from the Natural History Museum of
Denmark, University of Copenhagen. The extensive collections at the museum will
be used throughout the course to illustrate what we know and why we know it.</p>

Title:  Introduction to Mathematical Philosophy
Short desc:  Learn how to apply mathematical methods to philosophical problems and questions.
Long desc:  <p>Since antiquity, philosophers have questioned the foundations--the foundations of the physical world, of our everyday experience, of our scientific knowledge, and of culture and society. In recent
years, more and more young philosophers have become convinced
that, in order to understand these foundations, and thus to make progress in
philosophy, the use of mathematical methods is of crucial importance.
This is what our course will be concerned with:
mathematical philosophy, that is, philosophy done with the help of mathematical
methods.</p><p></p><p>As we will try to show, one can analyze philosophical concepts much more clearly in mathematical terms, one can derive philosophical conclusions from philosophical assumptions by mathematical proof, and one can build mathematical models in which we can study philosophical problems.</p><p></p><p>So, as Leibniz would have said: even in philosophy, <i>calculemus</i>. Let's calculate.</p><p></p><p></p>

Title:  Energy, the Environment, and Our Future
Short desc:  Get Rich and Save the Earth…Or Else!  Learn about the past, present, and possible futures of human energy use.
Long desc:  <span><div>Join
              internationally-acclaimed researcher and award-winning
              educator Richard Alley in an exploration of the role of
              energy in our environment and our future. Energy use has
              done great good for humans by giving those in the
              developed world the equivalent of 100 energy "serfs" to do
              our bidding, making up roughly 10% of the economy, and
              powering most of the economy.  However, the unintended
              consequences of energy use are affecting people around the
              world and changing the climate in ways that will make life
              much harder.  Numerous options exist for development of a
              sustainable energy system that provides a stronger
              economy, more jobs, and greater security that is more
              consistent with ethical principles.  The course explores
              these issues.<br>
               <br>
              “Energy, the Environment, and Our Future” will combine
              student-centered instructional materials and film clips
              from the PBS TV series <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RyvpsIx47E" target="_blank">Earth: The Operators' Manual</a>, also
              hosted by Richard Alley, to tell the history, present, and
              possible futures of human energy use.  <br>

Title:  Markets with Frictions
Short desc:  This course explores markets with frictions. The goal is to sharpen our economic reasoning, add a few twists that you are unlikely to have seen in other courses, and apply the methods to interesting phenomena. This should improve the way you think analytically about the economy, and help address interesting issues that come up in the real world.
Long desc:  <p>The classical economic theory of markets cannot account for some important
    issues, such as the coexistence of unemployment and vacancies; credit market
    rationing; or bubbles in asset prices. This course will explore
    markets with frictions, shedding light on these issues and other fundamental
    questions such as: What is a bank, and why do we use money?<br>

Title:  Tecnologías de información y comunicación en la educación
Short desc:  Analizar diferentes casos de estudio de usos educativos de las TIC y diseña un ambiente de aprendizaje que involucre herramientas digitales y tecnologías basadas en Internet. 
Long desc:  Las tecnologías de información y comunicación (TIC) han transformado la educación. Ello ocurre no sólo porque éstas han facilitado el desarrollo de algunas tareas que comúnmente realizábamos los profesores, los alumnos y los administradores sino porque también han abierto oportunidades para modificar tanto los ambientes de aprendizaje en los cuales se llevan a cabo los procesos educativos así como los métodos empleados para enseñar y aprender e incluso, cambiar los roles que anteriormente jugaba cada uno de los actores que intervenimos en el proceso educativo.<br><br> A lo largo de este curso analizaremos diferentes ambientes de aprendizaje y el papel que juegan las TIC en cada uno de ellos; reflexionando específicamente acerca de aquellos que podemos desarrollar nosotros mismos dados los contextos personales en los que nos encontramos.<br><br>El curso se imparte en español.<br><br><br><br>

Title:  Measuring Causal Effects in the Social Sciences
Short desc:  How can we know if the differences in wages between men and women are caused by discrimination or differences in background characteristics? In this course we look at causal effects as opposed to spurious relationships. We will discuss how they can be identified in the social sciences using quantitative data, and describe how this can help us understand social mechanisms. 
Long desc:  <p>In this course
we discuss how to identify causal effect in the social sciences. Causal effects
are interesting whenever we want to understand <i>mechanisms</i>. <br></p><p></p><p>As
an example we can think of the case of wage differentials across gender. This
may be due to either discrimination from employers or differences in unobserved
background characteristics across gender. Usually we would like to think about
discrimination as a mechanism whereas differences in background characteristics
would usually not been seen as a mechanism. So it may be important to be able
to tell why there is pay differences across gender. </p>



<p><span>To show
causal effects the provision of a statistical relationship is not enough.&nbsp; The fundamental problem in identifying causal
effects is therefore a matter of research design and research strategy. <br></span></p><p>During the course we will
examine such research designs and strategies and look at the relevance of different assumptions behind these
methods. The course also addresses the benefits of experimental data and introduces several new statistical and econometrical methods designed to improve causal statements from
non-experimental and observational data.</p><br>

Title:  Volcanic Eruptions: a material science.
Short desc:  Volcanic eruptions are a powerful demonstration of the energy of the Earth´s interior. A materials-based understanding of the evolution of erupting systems provides a quantitative physico-chemical description of the nature of lava and magma and the role of experiments in quantifying the eruptive process. 
Long desc:  <p>Geoscientists define
a “living planet” as one with active volcanism. By this definition our Earth is
very much alive, with many eruptions each year and with a far greater number of
“active volcanoes” that can potentially erupt in any given year.&nbsp;</p><p>In detail, each eruption is
different. Every volcano is its own physical and chemical system, occurs in its
own geological location, is subjected to its local stress field, and is at its
own stage in evolution in geological time.&nbsp;
External triggers of volcanic eruptions are also believed to play an
important role.</p><p>Yet powerful generalisations
and models of volcanic eruptions are indeed possible and in fact very useful in
dealing with the consequences of volcanic eruptions.</p>

<p>How are such models
constructed? They must rest on a basis of a mechanistic understanding of what
volcanoes are, and what they are doing – not just during eruptions but also in
the events leading up to eruptions, and not just at the Earth´s surface but
also at depth, where the magma is being prepared for the next eruption.</p><p>In addition to
field observations of past eruptions, monitoring of signals from magmatic
systems, and computer-based simulation of volcanic eruptions, increasingly,
high pressure and high temperature experiments are employed in order to answer
the question of how volcanic systems work.</p>

<p>These controlled laboratory conditions
for experimental volcanology are transforming the study of volcanoes from a
chiefly observational discipline where eruptive mechanisms were developed via
theoretical analysis of such observations, into a fully modern scientific
discipline where such theoretical approaches are either verified or rejected,
by the experimental picture of what is possible and what is not.</p><p>This course shows you how such experimental insight is&nbsp;obtained and what it tells us about erupting volcanoes.<br></p>

Title:  Understanding economic policymaking
Short desc:  This course will take a non-technical approach to understanding how governments influence the macroeconomy.  Topics will include fiscal policy, deficits and debts, monetary policy and structural reform.  We will review some current debates, such as fiscal stimulus vs. austerity and rules vs. quantitative easing.
Long desc:  <p>Developed countries are immersed in the worst crisis
since World War II.&nbsp; How are governments
responding?&nbsp; Could they do more?&nbsp; These are the questions that will be tackled
in this course.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The course begins with a review of some basic
macroeconomic concepts to lay the foundation for the policy framework.&nbsp; It then analyzes how fiscal policy works and
what the effects of today´s outsized deficits and debts could be on national
economies.&nbsp; Next it moves to monetary
policy and explores its drawbacks and the recourse to unconventional approaches, such as
quantitative easing.&nbsp; Finally, the course
looks at the other policies open to governments to address a crisis, and the
debate over how they have been used today.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

Students will finish
the course by trying their own hands at economic policymaking for an
unidentified country, with an online simulator exercise.<br><br><br>

Title:  Video Games and Learning
Short desc:  Video games aren’t just fun, they can be powerful vehicles for learning as well. In this course, we discuss research on the kinds of thinking and learning that go into video games and gaming culture, benefits and drawbacks of digital gameplay, tensions between youth culture and traditional education, and new developments intended to bridge that growing divide.
Long desc:  Video games are one of the fastest trending topics in media, education, and technology. Research across fields as disparate as science, literacy, history, visual processing, curriculum, and computer science suggests that video games aren’t just fun –
they can actually be good for your mind as well. In this course, we will discuss current research on the kinds of thinking and learning that go into video games and gaming culture. We’ll investigate the intellectual side of digital gameplay, covering
topics that range from perception and attention in Left 4 Dead 2 to the development of historical understanding in Civilization to collaborative learning in massively multiplayer online games like World of Warcraft. Throughout the course, we examine the
inherent tensions between contemporary youth culture and traditional education and new developments in games for learning that promise to help bridge that growing divide.

Title:  Globalizing Higher Education and Research for the ‘Knowledge Economy’
Short desc:  This course is designed to examine an array of issues related to the globalization of higher education and research. The main objective of the course is to enable students to better understand how and why universities are engaged in the globalization process, as well as what the key implications of this development process are.

Long desc:  <p>Universities and higher education systems worldwide are being transformed by new and changing actors, practices, programs, policies, and agendas. From notions of 'global competency' and 'international branch campuses,' to ever more common perceptions that international collaborative research is a desirable objective, through to the phenomena of bibliometrics, rankings and benchmarking that are framed and operate at a global scale, contexts are changing. This massive open online course (MOOC) itself, developed in Madison and Bristol and hosted on the Coursera platform in Silicon Valley, is a perfect case in point!</p><p><em>Globalizing Higher Education and Research for the ‘Knowledge Economy’ </em>is designed to help students better understand some of these complex changes. Our specific objectives are to:</p><p><ul><li>Provide an integrated 'big picture' regarding the globalization of higher education and research. &nbsp;</li><li>Reinforce the value of thinking about processes of change by focusing on <em>emergences</em> -- the forward edges of change -- as well as the frictions associated with these processes. We attempt to make this tangible by highlighting the role of relevant logics, thinkers, institutions, networks, technologies, ideas, temporalities, and regulations.</li><li>Highlight the role of relative and variable forms of power in shaping agendas and practices, as well as uneven development patterns and outcomes.</li></ul></p><p>In the end, we hope to stimulate some exciting globally oriented learning about how the higher education sector - from research to teaching, learning, and service (the 'third mission') - are changing.&nbsp;</p>

Title:  Age of Jefferson
Short desc:  This is a six week course providing an overview of Thomas Jefferson's work and perspectives presented by the University of Virginia in partnership with Thomas Jefferson’s Monticello.  Together, UVA and Monticello are recognized internationally as a UNESCO World Heritage Site.
Long desc:  Born in an age ruled by monarchs, Thomas
Jefferson thought that power ought to belong to those who possessed “virtue and
talent” rather than to aristocrats who had inherited it. He rejected the power
of kings in favor of ordinary people, believing that all men are created equal
and possess inherent natural rights. Jefferson became a powerful spokesman for
a revolutionary generation of Americans who created a new nation based on these
radical ideas. Thomas Jefferson remains today a pivotal figure in
American history whose influence continues to be felt nearly two centuries
after his death, both in the United States and around the world.  This
course will offer an introduction to Jefferson’s thought, focusing on several
key ideas and themes that engaged Jefferson throughout his public career and
private life.  We will address the three achievements that Jefferson asked
to be listed on his tombstone by discussing his roles in writing the Declaration
of Independence, in advocating religious freedom, and in advancing the cause of
education by founding the University of Virginia.  We will also seek to
understand what Jefferson meant when he proclaimed that “the earth belongs to
the living.”  And, crucially, we will explore Jefferson’s lifelong
relationship with the institution of slavery.<br><br><p>To
understand Jefferson’s ideas and why they continue to be relevant today, our
approach in each lecture will be to situate Jefferson in the context of his own
time and place.  Jefferson lived for many years in different
places—Philadelphia, New York, Paris, and Washington D.C., to name but a
few—but there is little doubt that he considered his home, Monticello, and the
nearby town of Charlottesville, in central Virginia, to be the center of his
world.  In this course, produced by the University of Virginia in close
partnership with the Thomas Jefferson Foundation, we will explore how
Jefferson’s identification with Monticello and the surrounding area influenced
him as he formulated ideas that have made a global impact.  After
completing the course it should be clear not only why Jefferson's legacy is
essential to understanding American history, but also why UNESCO has designated
Jefferson’s Monticello and the University of Virginia as a World Heritage Site.</p>

Title:  Sustainability of Food Systems: A Global Life Cycle Perspective
Short desc:  This course explores the diversity of the foods we eat, the ways in which we grow, process, distribute, and prepare them, and the impacts they have upon our environment, health, and society. We will also examine the challenges and opportunities of creating a more sustainable global food system in the future.
Long desc:  Hamburger or hummus? Organic or conventional? Mediterranean&nbsp;diet or&nbsp;McDonald's? What dietary choices are truly the most sustainable when&nbsp;we consider that what we eat affects not just our health but also the&nbsp;environment and the well-being of others?<br><br>This course will provide you with an overview of our world’s&nbsp;food system&nbsp;and its many impacts from the individual to the global scale. You&nbsp;will&nbsp;gain further appreciation of the complex implications of&nbsp;choices that are made&nbsp;along the food&nbsp;supply chain. You&nbsp;will be challenged to think critically about how the&nbsp;global food system may&nbsp;need to change to adapt to future economic&nbsp;and environmental conditions.<br><br>Our world’s population is projected to grow both in numbers and in wealth in the coming decades. Meeting future food demand, and doing so in a sustainable fashion, will require that we greatly increase the amount&nbsp;we produce and improve the efficiency by which it makes it to our tables.&nbsp;Join us as we explore today’s global food system and how we might improve its sustainability for our benefit and that of future generations.<br>

Title:  Critical Perspectives on Management
Short desc:  An unconventional approach to management strategy! This class offers students the opportunity to explore today's management practices from unexpected perspectives in order to ask provocative questions about the modern business environment. This approach will allow us to interrogate key management concepts in order to explore the thinking that informs them and, as importantly, the form of capitalism they foster.

 
Long desc:  <p><br></p><p>This course is designed for students of all backgrounds who have an interest in how firms are governed, the forces that have helped define modern management practice, and the outcomes of that practice not only for the firm itself, but also for the societies in which they operate. For students who are thinking of a career in management, it may also prove useful as a basic introduction to some of the conceptual vocabulary and ideas behind modern theories of management.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Using a wide disciplinary approach - from economics and history to social theory and even a smattering of biblical criticism - the course will invite students to consider several core management strategies and priorities from often unexpected perspectives in order to judge their success or failure. The key objective of the course is to bring into critical focus how
we think about the function and culture of management, how managers understand their role within a firm, how they take
decisions, set priorities and benchmark success and failure.&nbsp;</p>Topics include: the
function of the firm; the role of incentive; the ways in which narrative forces shape decision making, and how market relationships define the
managerial culture in ways that can lead to sub-optimal outcomes.<br><br>Update: the Facebook group is now open for enrolled students in this class.

Title:  History of Rock, Part One
Short desc:  Learn about the early days of rock music, from the pre-rock years of the post World War II era through the birth of rock in the mid 1950s to the psychedelic era of the late 1960s.
Long desc:  This course, part 1 of a 2-course sequence, examines the&nbsp;history of rock, primarily&nbsp;as it unfolded in the United States,&nbsp;from the days before rock (pre-1955) to the end of the 1960s. This course covers the music of Elvis Presley, Chuck Berry, Phil Spector,&nbsp;Bob Dylan, the Beatles, the Rolling Stones, Jimi Hendrix, Cream, and many more artists, with an emphasis both on cultural context and on the music itself. We will also explore how developments in&nbsp;the music business and in technology helped shape the ways in which styles developed.&nbsp;<br><br>Rock emerged in the mid 1950s as a blending of mainstream pop, rhythm and blues, and country and western--styles that previously&nbsp;had remained relatively separate. This new style became the music of the emerging youth culture and was often associated with teen rebellion. We will follow the story of how this rowdy first wave of rock and roll (1955-59) was tamed in the early 60s but came roaring back with the Beatles and the Rolling Stones and then went psychedelic&nbsp;by the end of the decade.

Title:  Creating Site-Specific Dance and Performance Works
Short desc:  This course will look into the process of creating live site-specific choreography and performance works from conception to production to performance. Site-specific dance/performance is work created in response to a particular place or site, inspired by its architecture/design, the history and/or current use.
Long desc:  <p>This course will look into the process of creating live site-specific choreography and performance works from conception, production to performance. Site-specific dance/performance is work created in response to a particular place or site, and is inspired by its architecture/design,
    the history and/or current use. We will investigate&nbsp;urban, architectural and environmental inspired site projects ranging from large-scale to small (guerrilla) style productions. We will&nbsp;delineate definitions of site-specificity, and&nbsp;look
    across the history of the field, focusing primarily on dance.</p>
<p>Specific techniques and approaches towards generating site-inspired choreography, developed over the last 25 years by site artist Stephan Koplowitz will be introduced. Aspects of navigating technical issues (lighting, sound, media) and a primer
    on producing (budgeting, obtaining permissions, insurance, fundraising, audience/event design) will also be covered.

Title:  History of Rock, Part Two
Short desc:  Learn about the growth of rock music, from the early 1970s through the rise of punk and disco in the late 1970s, and from the emergence of MTV, hip hop, and heavy metal in 1980s to the rebellion of Nirvana in the early 90s.
Long desc:  This course, part 2 of a 2-course sequence, examines the&nbsp;history of rock, primarily as it unfolded in the United States,&nbsp;from the early 1970s to the early 1990s. This course covers the music of Led Zeppelin, the Allman Brothers, Carole King, Bob Marley, the Sex Pistols, Donna Summer, Michael Jackson, Madonna, Prince, Metallica, Run-DMC, and Nirvana,&nbsp;and many more artists, with an emphasis both on cultural context and on the music itself. We will also explore how developments in&nbsp;the music business and in technology helped shape the ways in which styles developed.&nbsp;<br><br>Emerging out of the experimental and ambitious years of late-60s psychedelia, rock splintered into a variety of styles in the 1970s as the music business continued to expand. By the end of the decade, punk and disco had challenged the excesses of the&nbsp;hippie aesthetic, as rock became more commercially streamlined and radio friendly. The emergence and rise of MTV transformed pop music and propelled the careers of Michael jackson and Madonna, while heavy metal and hip hop dominated the late 1980s. Nirvana leads alt-rock's&nbsp;return to simplicity in the early 1990s.&nbsp;

Title:  機率 (Probability)
Short desc:  這是一個機率的入門課程，著重的是教授機率基本概念。另外我們的作業將搭配臺大電機系所開發的多人競技線上遊戲方式，讓同學在遊戲中快樂的學習，快速培養同學們對於機率的洞察力與應用能力。
Long desc:  <p>由於人類的所知有限，無法完全掌握這個世界的所有運作。就如同一個沒念書的小孩，在考試時只能以過去的經驗揣摩老師的答案，何者機率最高。 人類在面對這個非全知的世界，就如同那小孩一般，只能以機率的概念來揣摩、了解這個世界，進而做決策。因此機率在很多的領域都普遍的被應用，如工程、財務等。</p>
<p>這門課程是機率的入門課程，我們將介紹機率的重要概念。有別於一般機率課程多著重於數學理論的證明，使得學生在面對實際問題時不知如何下手。這門課的教學將透過生活化的例子，讓同學學會如何「用」機率，如何應用機率的概念來解決實際的問題。</p>
<p>另外，我們在這個課程當中，將搭配使用我們在臺灣大學所開發的多人競技線上遊戲系統，來幫助大家快速成長。競技的過程中充滿樂趣，過去兩年臺大電機的機率課搭配這套系統使用，有不少同學便因此對機率解題「上癮」。</p>
<p>想學機率嗎？想充滿樂趣的學習機率嗎？想跟全世界的學生一較高下一起學機率嗎？這是有史以來第一次在線上課程出現的多人競技線上遊戲，歡迎你一起來加入！</p>

Title:  Terrorism and Counterterrorism: Comparing Theory and Practice
Short desc:  Students, policy makers, journalists or anyone with a strong interest in terrorism and counter terrorism studies and trends will find the course most relevant. It will equip you with a range of insights that help you to analyze and understand these complex phenomena. 
Long desc:  <p>

</p>
<p>Terrorism has arguably been one of the defining factors of our age. It frequently makes headlines, threatening or attacking governments, private business and ordinary citizens. And in many parts of the world, it has been one of the most important threats
    to peace, security and stability. But what does this exactly mean? What is the nature of this threat? Who or what is threatened, how, by whom and why? What can be done about it or how can we at least limit the impact of terrorism and make sure that
    terrorists do not make headlines and manage to scare us?</p>
<p>These are just a handful of questions that will be addressd in this course that consists of three parts. First it focuses on the essence of terrorism as an instrument to achieve certain goals, in addition to an exploration of this phenomenon and the
    difficulties in defining it. The second part provides an overview of the state of the art in (counter) terrorism studies. Since ‘9/11’ terrorism studies have grown exponentially, reflecting the rise in perceived threats. But what has academia come
    up with? What theories, assumptions and conventional wisdom has it produced that could be of help in understanding terrorism and dealing with it? The most interesting results are examined and compared with empirical evidence with the aim to either
    stress their importance or to debunk them as myths. The final part looks into the implications and possibilities for policy making.</p><p><br></p>

Title:  中國古代歷史與人物－－秦始皇
Short desc:  本課程是作為歷史入門通識而設計，重點在於藉由歷史教育啟發同學的思維，而非背誦歷史知識。具體的課程目標，是為了讓修課同學感到：
（一）有趣：重新發現學習歷史的樂趣。
（二）有用：重新認識學習歷史的價值。

Long desc:  <div>在近代以前，歷史學是培養各種領袖與人才的必備教育，因為它能夠使人對過去「稽其興壞成敗之理」（《史記‧太史公自序》）。「中國古代歷史與人物」這門課程希望回到歷史學的原點，藉由具體的事例，來探索「讀歷史到底有什麼用？」。</div><div><br>從東周到秦漢是中國歷史上承先啟後的鉅變時期，更是一個英雄輩出、波瀾壯闊的大時代。而秦始皇正是主導這個時代，且令後世爭議不絕的歷史關鍵人物之一。本課程將利用現代歷史學的各種取徑，以原典史料為中心，結合考古成果、古代文物等，對歷史人物進行多角度的剖析，探索秦始皇及其統治集團成功和失敗的祕密究竟何在，並希望使同學藉此明瞭歷史學的功用與價值。<br></div>

Title:  Bioinformatics Algorithms (Part 1) 
Short desc:  This course will cover some of the common algorithms underlying the following fundamental topics in bioinformatics: assembling genomes, comparing DNA and protein sequences,  finding regulatory motifs, analyzing genome rearrangements, identifying proteins, and many other topics. 
Long desc:  <p><span class="GingerNoCheckStart"></span>The sequencing of the&nbsp;human genome a decade ago&nbsp;fueled a computational revolution
    in biology, which&nbsp;has arguably been an impetus for more new&nbsp;algorithms
    than any other fundamental realm of&nbsp;science.&nbsp; The newly formed&nbsp;links
    between computer science and biology affect the way we teach computational
    ideas to biologists, as well as how applied algorithms are taught to computer
    scientists.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Genome sequencing is just one of hundreds of biological problems that
    have become inextricable from the computational methods required to solve
    them. In this course, we will take a look at some of the algorithmic ideas
    that are&nbsp;fundamental to an&nbsp;understanding of modern biology.&nbsp;
    Computational concepts like dynamic programming and graph theory&nbsp;will
    help us explore algorithms applied to&nbsp;a wide range of biological topics,
    from finding regulatory motifs&nbsp;to reconstructing the tree of life.&nbsp; Throughout
    the process, we will apply&nbsp;<i>real</i> bioinformatics algorithms to&nbsp;<i>real</i> genetic
    data.</p>
<p>We have created an interactive textbook for this course, which allows you to learn and solve problems concurrently. &nbsp;This textbook will be hosted on <a href="https://beta.stepic.org/2" target="_blank" title="Link: https://beta.stepic.org/2">Stepic</a>,&nbsp;a new resource for learning interactively.</p><span class="GingerNoCheckEnd"></span>

Title:  Analyzing the Universe
Short desc:  Using publicly available data from NASA of actual satellite observations of astronomical  x-ray sources, we explore some of the mysteries of the cosmos, including neutron stars, black holes, quasars and supernovae.
Long desc:  <span> Science is really not about looking up facts in an encyclopedia.  It is a <i>process</i> that
extends what we know into the realm of the unexplored.  This can be
exciting, certainly; to be able to sneak a peek at the Universe at its strange,
awesome, cosmic best.  But it is very different from your run-of-the-mill
standard “textbook” idea of science.  Science is a social, human endeavor.<br></span><br><span>And as human beings, we crave authenticity.  We have seen the trappings of
society, we act as if we have mastered technology, and yet we know that
something is lacking.  We have succumbed to the lure of Ebay, Facebook and
Amazon (at least, I know <u>I</u> have!), and yet we remain unsatisfied at some primal level. 
It’s time to peel away the layers of glitzy imagery and use our machines to exploit their ultimate purpose: the capability to  process large amounts
of data with instructions that we provide, in order to test our ideas about how
the Universe seems to behave.  In short, to do Science.</span><span>  For the
first time, it is possible for the interested student (and we are <u>all</u>
students, <u>especially</u> those that have any claim to be considered
“learned” , such as the instructor!) to have this experience on-line. <br><br></span><p>The subject matter for this course will be divided into two
broad components which will be interwoven in an interdisciplinary fashion. The first is a general introduction to the physics and astronomy
information you will need to understand basic phenomena that occur in the realm
of x-ray astrophysics; the second is the presentation of authentic satellite
data from various exciting types of x-ray sources, which you will analyze to
better understand the working of the high-energy Universe in which we live.
There are no prerequisites for this course, other than high-school mathematics
(algebra and trigonometry).<br></p><p> I hope you will enjoy your experience in "Analyzing the Universe".</p>

Title:  Live!:  A History of Art for Artists, Animators and Gamers
Short desc:  Explore art history from the artist's perspective.  Learn how contemporary artists, animators and gamers work from the art of the past as part of their creative process, while building your own skills in visual analysis and creative and critical thinking.

Long desc:  <p>This course approaches the questions of “art” and “history”
from the perspective of contemporary makers of art (sculpture, painting,
photography, performance, installation and more), animators (whether
character/story-based or experimental) and gamers, asking how artists actively
make a history for their own practices by thinking about the creative process
as a “conversation” with a wide range of art from the past.  Why are ground-breaking artists so often
historically-minded (and yet tend to break all the rules of conventional
history-telling)?  How do animators
themselves “write” the largely unwritten history of their art through
quotation, transposition and mash-ups? 
Why should contemporary gamers look at classical painting anyway?</p>

<p>This course will combine short video lectures/interviews and
interactive quizzes with independent, peer-reviewed sketchbook and field work (suggested visits to
local museums, film viewings, etc.).  It is
intended to give the student a background in a wide range of visual practices and
a greater familiarity with techniques of historical analysis.  It will help to build skills in visual
analysis, and will also provide insight into the creative culture of CalArts,
where a certain portion of these art histories have been made in the first
place.</p>

Title:  Conception et mise en œuvre d'algorithmes.
Short desc:  Modéliser un problème, concevoir un algorithme de résolution et en proposer une implémentation correcte. Du problème à sa solution, ce cours combine approches pragmatique, pratique et théorique de l'informatique.
Long desc:  Ce cours vous fera découvrir différents aspects de la conception d'un programme. Au travers de nombreuses études de cas, nous mettrons en exergue les structures de données et les algorithmes permettant d'apporter des solutions. Comme souvent en informatique, il n'existe pas de solution unique et nous serons amenés à découvrir différentes classes d'algorithme et à les comparer.<br>Nous introduirons à cet effet la notion de complexité d'un programme, c'est à dire à la fois une estimation du temps d'exécution de votre programme et de l'espace requis par celui-ci. Il est tentant de croire que le "meilleur" programme est celui qui minimise le temps d'exécution mais très souvent cette complexité est contrainte par la mémoire dont vous disposez. Ainsi, vous n'utiliserez peut-être pas le même algorithme selon que votre programme s'exécute sur un ordinateur ou un téléphone !

Title:  Initiation à la théorie des distributions
Short desc:  Une fonction discontinue peut-elle être solution d'une équation différentielle? Comment définir rigoureusement la masse de Dirac (une "fonction" d'intégrale un, nulle partout sauf en un point) et ses dérivées? Peut-on définir une notion de "dérivée d'ordre fractionnaire"?  Cette initiation aux distributions répond à ces questions - et à bien d'autres.
Long desc:  Dans plusieurs domaines des sciences (physique, mécanique, analyse numérique, etc.) apparaît la nécessité de développer un calcul différentiel "généralisé" pour des fonctions peu régulières, par exemple discontinues. La première leçon présente une situation de ce genre. L'objet de ce cours est d'introduire la théorie des distributions qui fournit une réponse élégante à ce problème.<br><br>Dans un premier temps, nous présentons la notion de distribution, généralisant la notion de fonction, et les premières propriétés de ces objets mathématiques. <br><br>On montre ensuite comment certaines opérations bien connues sur les fonctions, en particulier la dérivation, se prolongent naturellement au cadre des distributions. <br><br>Le cours s'achève sur quelques applications à des exemples classiques d'équations aux dérivées partielles linéaires.<br><br>

Title:  Aléatoire : une Introduction aux Probabilités 
Short desc:  Ce cours introduit le concept de Probabilité, dont la puissance permet de modéliser d'innombrables situations où le hasard intervient. Il est fondé sur le livre de Sylvie Méléard "Aléatoire : introduction à la théorie et au calcul des probabilités" qui résulte lui-même du cours de tronc commun de première année de l'École polytechnique.
Long desc:  La modélisation probabiliste est fondamentale dans tous les domaines d'applications. Mentionnons la physique, l'informatique, les réseaux de télécommunications, la finance, l'assurance, la biologie et la médecine. Modéliser tant de situations
différentes où le hasard intervient requiert un cadre général abstrait qui ne fut rigoureusement défini qu'en 1933 par Kolmogorov. 
<br>C'est ce grand écart entre l'apparente simplicité de certains problèmes probabilistes concrets et l'abstraction que nécessite leur résolution qui peut
<br>rendre le monde de l'aléatoire difficile voire inquiétant, mais c'est aussi ce qui en fait un domaine des mathématiques d'une grande richesse.
<br>
<br>Le but de ce cours est d'en convaincre les étudiants par une introduction des notions de base de la théorie des probabilités. Il n'exige pas de pré-requis en théorie de la mesure et de l'intégration. Les outils d'analyse nécessaires à une bonne compréhension
des objets probabilistes sont fournis au fur et à mesure de leur construction, mettant ainsi en lumière leur nécessité. 
<br>Le contenu du cours va de la définition d'une probabilité au théorème de la limite centrale, et contient également un ouverture aux processus aléatoires.

Title:  Early Renaissance Architecture in Italy: from Alberti to Bramante
Short desc:  Through some of the most celebrated examples of the early Renaissance architecture and the most important statements of the early Renaissance theories, the course will examine problems of the architectural spaces, technology and forms looking to the antiquity in the XV century in Italy.
Long desc:  <p><b>Early Renaissance Architecture in Italy: from Alberti
to Bramante</b>

</p>
<p><span>When
Leon Battista Alberti completed<i> </i>his
treatise about architecture around 1452, his initial study of texts and
monuments of Antiquity was based on mathematics and geometry as a reflection of
nature, with a belief that architecture was a part of a man's civil duty.</span>

</p>
<p>This<span> attitude would
condition the architectural principles of the early Renaissance and architects
did not apply themselves to textual imitations of individual antique monuments.
In Florence, they preferred to accept and articulate the rational “system” of
Brunelleschi, either transforming it, like Alberti, or breaking with<b> </b>it in a return to tradition, like
Michelozzo. In north and south Italy, the battle between innovation and resistance
was increasing in strength and substance because it not only encompassed
immediate questions of decorative language 
(antique forms and architectural orders) but also the problems of
conceiving and constructing an architecture that could replace the gothic
structural membering with the continuous masonry of the Antiquity. At first,
the new decoration was frequently adapted to the existing architectural system,
and only later did it find a partner in the different spatial and structural
conceptions that descended from Florentine exempla. The tendency to see norms
and models in antique architecture, which must be rigidly replicated, first
affirmed itself at the beginning of the XVI century in Rome.</span>

</p>
<p>Through some of the most celebrated examples of the early Renaissance
    architecture and the most important statements of the early Renaissance
    theories, the course will examine problems of the architectural spaces,
    technology and forms in the XV century in Italy, from Leon Battista Alberti’s
    to Francesco di Giorgio’s and Bramante’s proposals.<br></p>

Title:  Recovering the Humankind Past and Saving the Universal Heritage
Short desc:  Archaeology has as its objective the recovery and revival of humankind past, and as its aim the rescue and preservation of cultural heritage.
Long desc:  Archaeology has
        as its objective the recovery and revival of humankind past,
        and as its aim
        the rescue and preservation of cultural heritage. The past was
        always the
        object of attention in the ancient civilizations. In the modern
        world,
        Archaeology is no longer about the&nbsp;classification of found objects, but rather about&nbsp;understanding ancient
        cultures. Its fascination is precisely in its methods: a path
        inevitably
        fluctuating between identity and alterity. <br>

Title:  La visione del mondo della Relatività e della Meccanica Quantistica
Short desc:  In questo corso imparerete come la fisica del XX secolo, con la Relatività e la Meccanica Quantistica, abbia cambiato la nostra visione del mondo.
Long desc:  La fisica del XX secolo, con le teorie della Relatività e della Meccanica Quantistica, ha cambiato radicalmente la visione del mondo che ci circonda. Dallo spazio e tempo assoluti e indipendenti si è passati ad una descrizione di un mondo in cui distanze
ed intervalli di tempo dipendono da chi le osserva, in cui l’ordine di accadimento di due eventi non è univoco, in cui la velocità del tempo segnato da un orologio dipende da quali corpi si trovino vicino. Nel microscopico si è invece abbandonata la descrizione
della fisica classica, magari caotica, ma sempre deterministica, per arrivare ad una descrizione probabilistica, in cui gli stati e le proprietà del mondo microscopico non sono determinati, a priori, intrinsecamente, ma acquisiscono realtà solo se vengano
misurati o se entrino in contatto con altri “oggetti”. L’abbandono della realtà locale, del fatto cioè che le azioni esercitate in un luogo, per particolari sistemi, possono avere effetti istantanei su oggetti a distanze virtualmente infinite, stravolgono
la descrizione di un mondo che fino al secolo scorso sembrava sensato e ragionevole. Nel corso verranno descritte le principali caratteristiche di queste due teorie, di come abbiano cambiato il concetto del nostro universo e delle possibilità di conoscerlo,
e di come abbiano influito nella vita quotidiana.

Title:  The Diversity of Exoplanets
Short desc:  The course will provide an overview of the knowledge acquired during the past 20 years in the domain of exoplanets. It will review the different detection methods, their limitations, and the information provided on the orbital system and the planet itself, and how this information is helping our understanding of planet formation.
Long desc:  The discovery of extra-solar planets orbiting other stars has been one of the major breakthroughs in astronomy of the past decades, changing our view on the formation of planetary systems, mainly drawn from the observation of the Solar System. Today, over 860 exoplanets are known and the Kepler satellite has recently identified over 2700 additional candidates, most of them awaiting for confirmation. We have learned that exoplanets are extremely common objects in the Universe and that planetary systems are much more diverse than originally predicted. <br><br>Our knowledge about exoplanets has dramatically increased thanks to the systematic monitoring of stars in the solar neighborhood by radial velocities, photometry, microlensing, and recently direct imaging, bringing valuable constraints to planet formation theories, as well as to models of planet interior structure, and atmosphere physics. In this course, we will review the main discoveries, describing the different approaches to detect exoplanets and characterise their orbital and physical properties.<br>

Title:  Law and the Entrepreneur 
Short desc:  This course will highlight the critical legal and business issues entrepreneurs face as they build and launch a new venture.  We will explore real world scenarios, and address the legal and business issues that entrepreneurs face, from the moment they conceive of the "million dollar idea" to all of the important junctures along the path to success.
Long desc:  Are you a passionate entrepreneur with a new business idea, but feeling
intimidated by the law?  Or perhaps you
are a lawyer or aspiring lawyer looking to break into the exciting world of
start-ups?  This course addresses the
legal aspects of entrepreneurship, and is appropriate both for entrepreneurs and
lawyers who hope to represent entrepreneurs. Entrepreneurs face many challenges
as they pursue a new business idea.  With
the right legal tools, they can take steps that provide significant legal
protections and avoid future liability.  Among
other subjects, the course will cover American law on choice of entity (corporation,
limited liability company, partnership, sole proprietorship), selection of a
company name and trademark, protecting intellectual property of the business
with patent, trade secret, trademark and copyright law, structuring agreements
among owners, venture capital and other equity and debt financing arrangements,
and the relationship between attorneys and entrepreneurs. In
addition to discussing applicable legal rules, the course will focus on
practical steps entrepreneurs and their lawyers can take to build and protect a
new venture.  The goal of the course will
be for students to have a better understanding of practical ways they can
protect a new venture and spot potential issues from a business-legal perspective.<br><br><br>

Title:  Constitutional Struggles in the Muslim World
Short desc:  Learn what motivates the restive Muslim youth from Tunis to Tehran, what political positions Islamists from Mali to Chechnya are fighting for, where the seeming obsession with Islamic law comes from, where the secularists have vanished to, and whether it makes sense to speak of an Islamic state.
Long desc:  <p>Since 2009 there has been a renewed wave of
popular unrest sweeping throughout much of the Muslim world. Secular, but
generally repressive and inefficient autocracies have come under pressure or
been swept aside entirely. At the same, the various Islamic Republics have not
fared much better, but been convulsed by internal unrest, economic and social
decline. Throughout the Muslim lands, existing constitutional arrangements are
being challenged, often very violently. </p>

<p><span>This course is a survey of the
constitutional ideas and institutions that have developed since the mid 19th
century throughout predominantly Muslim countries, but its focus will lie on
the <i>actors</i> that have dominated this
discourse and shaped its outcomes. We will look at the large body of classical
writings on the Islamic state only in so far as it is necessary to understand
the contemporary debate, but concentrate on the legal and political
developments of the 20th and 21st centuries.</span></p><p></p><p>Three common themes will characterise the course: </p><p></p><p></p><ul><li>We privilege the study of the <i>legal and social reality</i> and seek to highlight where it is at odds with dogmatic stipulations, be they religious or constitutional. </li></ul><p></p><p></p><ul><li>We seek to illustrate the <i>practical tensions</i> posed by limited administrative capabilities and political legitimacy that resulted from the incomplete reception of modern bureaucratic statehood. </li></ul><p></p><p></p><ul><li>We seek to examine how <i>popular dissatisfaction</i> with the practical performance of Muslim governments has fuelled demands for greater accountability under the guise of cultural authenticity. </li></ul><p></p><p></p><p>Ultimately, the course aims to equip participants to better understand Muslim contemporary discourse about the <i>res publica</i>, better contextualise the demands for religious law in public life, and to better ascertain the theoretical and practical feasibility of postulated religious alternatives to the still-dominant secular model of governance.</p><p></p>

Title:  How Green Is That Product? An Introduction to Life Cycle Environmental Assessment
Short desc:  In this course you will learn the basics of the life-cycle assessment (LCA) method for holistic environmental analysis of products, technologies, and systems. LCA sheds light on the environmental implications of the consumption and behavioral choices we all make on a daily basis.
Long desc:  Paper or plastic? Hybrid or conventional vehicles? Which is
better for the environment? To answer these questions, one must take
a holistic systems view using a quantitative approach known as life cycle
assessment.
<br>
<br>Life cycle assessment (LCA) is a fundamental method for assessing the
environmental impacts of products and technologies from a "cradle to grave"
systems perspective. It is an essential tool for anyone who performs
environmental analyses or uses the results of such analyses for decision
making. 
<br>
<br>The course will provide an introduction to LCA methods and applications. Students taking this course will emerge with a solid understanding of why
an LCA systems perspective is important, basic skills for sound application
of the LCA method and proper interpretation of its results, and an appreciation
for the strengths and limitations of LCA in practice. The course
will cover the four major steps in LCA: (1) goal definition and scope;
(2) life-cycle inventory compilation; (3) life-cycle impact assessment;
and (4) interpretation and management. The course will include a
hands-on modeling project, which the students will perform in parallel
to the lectures to reinforce learning objectives and to gain experience
in LCA application.

Short desc:  In this course you will learn several fundamental principles of advanced algorithm design: greedy algorithms and applications; dynamic programming and applications; NP-completeness and what it means for the algorithm designer; the design and analysis of heuristics; and more.
Long desc:  <div>In this course you will learn several fundamental principles of advanced algorithm design. You'll learn the greedy algorithm design paradigm, with applications to computing good network backbones (i.e., spanning trees) and good codes for data compression. You'll learn the tricky yet widely applicable dynamic programming algorithm design paradigm, with applications to routing in the Internet and sequencing genome fragments. &nbsp;You’ll learn what NP-completeness and the famous “P vs. NP” problem mean for the algorithm designer. &nbsp;Finally, we’ll study several strategies for dealing with hard (i.e., NP-complete problems), including the design and analysis of heuristics. &nbsp;Learn how shortest-path algorithms from the 1950s (i.e., pre-ARPANET!) govern the way that your Internet traffic gets routed today; why efficient algorithms are fundamental to modern genomics; and how to make a million bucks in prize money by “just” solving a math problem!</div>

Title:  Content Strategy for Professionals: Engaging Audiences for Your Organization
Short desc:  This professional Content Strategy MOOC is for people anywhere in an organization who have content development experience and now want to significantly improve their abilities to understand audiences and develop strategic words, pictures, graphics, and videos to convey their organization’s most important goals.
Long desc:  Why Content Strategy is essential for professionals in any organization – business,
non-profit, or government.
<br>
<br>Content Strategy is a conversation that provides thought-leadership. It
starts a “conversation” with users and stakeholders inside and outside
an organization.  Conversations are the natural way people think about
complex issues. Conversations also enable people to develop “stories,”
which lead to understanding and helpful mental pictures. Content Strategy
practitioners are at all levels of the best enterprises – in all departments
and sectors from the top leader to the newcomer in the ranks.
<br>
<br>In this complex information age, forward-thinking employees know that
if they and their organizations are to thrive, they need to go beyond their
job descriptions. They must master the most demanding communications frontier
– creating engaging, strategic, honest stories and information that is
valued by their most important audiences. In turn that will make their
enterprise stand out.
<br>
<br>Regardless of their department, area of work, or expertise, Content Strategy
practitioners know how to use words, pictures, video, and social and mobile
media to interact with their most important constituents with trustable,
actionable information that the audience values and will use. The strategic
content they produce enhances the audience’s lives and deepens their
understanding and engagement with the organization.
<br>
<br>Content Strategy is similar to the best examples of journalism, but it
is done by non-journalism organizations. Content Strategy is always honest,
trustable, and transparent. It tells all sides of every story it reports.
Often it is also deeper and directed at topics and audiences that traditional
journalism under-serves or does not reach at all. Content Strategy is not
advertising, marketing, or public relations. It is different because it
never pursues the persuasive goals that are appropriate in those disciplines.

Title:  Inspiring Leadership through Emotional Intelligence
Short desc:  Emotional intelligence, hope, mindfulness, and compassion help a person reverse the damage of chronic stress and build great leadership relationships. The Positive and Negative Emotional Attractors inspire sustained, desired change and learning at many levels. 
Long desc:  <p>Great leaders move us through our emotions. They establish a deep emotional
    connection with others called resonance. Their own levels of emotional
    intelligence allow them to create and nurture these resonant relationships.
    They use their EI as a path to resonant leadership through mindfulness,
    hope, compassion, and playfulness. Unfortunately, most people in leadership
    and helping positions (i.e., doctors, teachers, coaches, etc.) lose their
    effectiveness over time because of the cumulative damage from chronic stress.
    But humans can renew themselves, neurologically, hormonally, and emotionally.</p>
<p>Based on decades of&nbsp;research into emotional intelligence&nbsp;competencies
    and longitudinal studies of their development, the course will examine
    resonance and developing "resonant leadership" capability,&nbsp;emotional
    intelligence, and the experiences of mindfulness, hope, and compassion.
    Using the latest in neuroscience, behavioral, organizational and psychological
    research, participants will&nbsp;understand the theory, research, and experience
    of the Positive Emotional Attractor that is an essential beginning to sustained,
    desired change for individuals, teams, organizations and communities.&nbsp;</p><p>The course will consist of nine classes, with three or so
modules per class, to be taken over 8 weeks. Each module will consist of a
video, assigned and recommended readings, reflective exercises, writing in your
Personal Journal, and on-line, asynchronous discussions. Each class will have personal
learning assignments to use and tests of comprehension.&nbsp;</p>

Title:  Comic Books and Graphic Novels
Short desc:  Comic books have arrived! "Comic Books and Graphic Novels" presents a survey of the comic book canon and of the major graphic novels in circulation today. Its governing question is simple: by what terms can we discuss comic books as literary art? In pursuit of that question it develops a theory of literary reading and time itself.

Visit us at www.facebook.com/UCBComics
Reddit Username: Kuskin (staff cpav13)
Long desc:  The comic book pamphlet developed as an independent literary form in the 1930s and early 1940s and has been a favorite of adolescent enthusiasts and cult devotees ever since. Recently, it has entered into a process of transformation, moving from a species
of pulp fiction on the margins of children’s literature to an autonomous genre, one Will Eisner labeled the graphic novel. This transformation has been noted in such literary venues as the New York Times and the New Yorker, as well as in an increasing
number of university classrooms and bookstore shelves.
<br>
<br>“Comic Books and Graphic Novels” presents a survey of the history of American comics and a review of major graphic novels circulating in the U. S. today. It is focused on three main points. First, it argues that as comics develop in concert with, and
participate in literary culture, they should be considered literature. Second, it reasons that such a designation forces us to redefine our concept of literature itself. Finally, it explores this transformative literary world by arguing that comics have
much to teach us about ourselves.

Title:  El ABC del emprendimiento esbelto 
Short desc:  A través de diferentes actividades de campo el participante vive personalmente el proceso emprendedor, aprendiendo los conceptos del curso principalmente con base en la experimentación. 
Long desc:  <p>A pesar de que una gran parte de la literatura sobre emprendimiento prepara
    al “candidato emprendedor” a cómo hacer planes de negocio para conseguir
    financiamiento proveniente de supuestos inversionistas, tal y como lo hace
    la tradición norteamericana de enseñanza del emprendimiento, la realidad
    de negocios nos dice que inclusive en los países desarrollados los proyectos
    emprendedores inician con sus recursos financieros propios y normalmente
    muy escasos.</p>La principal herramienta para estos emprendimientos no
es el plan de negocios ni el financiamiento, sino la creatividad empresarial. 
Por lo que, para una enseñanza efectiva del proceso emprendedor, hay que
partir de esta realidad y no solo imitar lo que sucede en universidades,
principalmente norteamericanas, con un contexto muy diferente al resto
del mundo. Por otro lado, pareciera un misterio el por qué solo muy pocos
proyectos de empresa o de negocio tienen éxito, pareciera una combinación
entre el “culto” a la personalidad del emprendedor y suerte; sin embargo
la realidad nos demuestra que los proceso emprendedores que tienen éxito,
si bien tiene una influencia la importante motivación y la persona, siguen
un proceso con etapas específicas, un patrón de acciones muy similar, aunque
los emprendedores no se hayan dado cuenta de este proceso.
<br>
<br>
<p>Este curso invita al participante a tener la persistencia para seguir
    este proceso emprendedor basado en la experimentación.</p>

Title:  Linear and Integer Programming
Short desc:  This course will cover the very basic ideas in optimization. Topics include the basic theory and algorithms behind linear and integer linear programming along with some of the important applications. We will also explore the theory of convex polyhedra using linear programming.

Long desc:  <div><p>Linear Programming (LP) is arguably one of the most important optimization problems in applied mathematics and engineering. The Simplex algorithm to solve linear programs is widely regarded as one among the "<a href="http://www.siam.org/pdf/news/637.pdf">top ten</a>" algorithms of the 20th century. Linear Programs arise in almost all fields of engineering including operations research, statistics, machine learning, control system design, scheduling, formal verification and computer vision. It forms the basis for numerous approaches to solving hard combinatorial optimization problems through randomization and approximation.</p><p><br></p><p>The primary goals of this course will be to:</p><p>1. Understand the basic theory behind LP, algorithms to solve LPs, and the basics of (mixed) integer programs.</p><p>2. Understand important and emerging applications of LP to economic problems (optimal resource allocation, scheduling problems), machine learning (SVM), control design (finite horizon optimal control, dynamic programming), and formal verification (ranking functions, symbolic execution, SMT solvers).</p><p>At the end of the course, the successful student will be able to cast various problems that may arise in her research as optimization problems, understand the cases where the optimization problem will be linear, choose appropriate solution methods and interpret results appropriately.<i> This is generally considered a useful ability in many research areas.</i></p></div><div></div><div><br></div>

Title:  Physics 1 for Physical Science Majors
Short desc:  This is a 12 week course, currently scheduled to start on Monday, April 14, 2014 and finishing on Friday, July 11.  This introductory physics course is intended for physical science majors and others desiring a rigorous introduction to physics. It closely parallels the brick-and-mortar course given to the freshmen at the University of Colorado at Boulder. The course covers classical mechanics, including kinematics, dynamics, conservation laws, and applications. 
Long desc:  <p>This course is a rigorous introduction to classical mechanics, which is the study of forces and motion.  How does gravity control the motion of the
planets around the sun or the motion of a projectile fired from a cannon?  Why does a spinning skater spin faster when
she pulls her arms in?  Why is a
perpetual motion machine impossible? These are the kinds of questions which can
be answered with classical mechanics, which was first formulated by Isaac
Newton around 1666. Classical, or Newtonian Mechanics is the oldest branch of
physics, but it will never go out of style. 
It remains the foundation of our understanding of the physical world and
is constantly used by engineers and scientists. There is a space probe, called
New Horizons, that is on its way to Pluto right now, and it will arrive on July
14, 2015, exactly on time and on target, because its path has been computed
using classical mechanics, and nothing
more.</p>

</p><p>From the Nuremberg trial to the case against Saddam Hussein,
from the prosecution of Al-Qaeda terrorists to the trial of Somali pirates – no
area of law is as important to world peace and security as international
criminal law.  Taught by one of the world’s leading experts in the field,
this course will educate students about the fundamentals of international
criminal law and policy.  We will explore the contours of international
crimes such as genocide, war crimes, terrorism, and piracy.  We will
examine unique modes of international criminal liability and specialized
defenses.  And we will delve into the challenges of obtaining custody of
the accused and maintaining control of the courtroom.</p>

Title:  Health for All Through Primary Health Care
Short desc:  This course explores why primary health care is central for achieving Health for All. It provides examples of how primary health care has been instrumental in approaching this goal in selected populations and how the principles of primary health care can guide future policies and actions.
Long desc:  Two of the most inspiring, least understood, and most often derided terms
in global health discourse are “Health for All” and “Primary Health Care.”
In this course, we will explore these terms in the context of global health,
their origins and meanings, the principles upon which they rest, and examples
of how these principles have been implemented both at small scale as well
as at large scale. We will also explore some ultra-low-cost approaches
to Health for All through primary health care and the promise that primary
health care holds for eventually achieving Health for All.
<br>
<br>The course consists of six one-hour lectures with readings and opportunities
for discussions among those taking the course and interactions with the
professor.

Title:  Soul Beliefs: Causes and Consequences
Short desc:  Exploration of the causes and consequences of various beliefs about the soul. Topics such as the self, mind/body dualism, evolution, culture, death anxiety, afterlife, and religious and political conflict.
Long desc:  <p>Throughout history, the vast majority of people around the globe have
    believed they have, however defined, a “soul.” While the question of whether
    the soul exists cannot be answered by <span>science, what
we can study are the causes and consequences of various <i>beliefs </i>about
the soul and its prospects of surviving the death of the body. Why are soul and
afterlife beliefs so common in human history? Are there adaptive advantages to
assuming souls exist?  Are there brain
structures that have been shaped by environmental pressures that provide the
foundation of body/mind dualism that is such a prominent feature of many
religions? How do these beliefs shape the worldviews of different cultures and
our collective lives? What is the role of competing afterlife beliefs in
religion, science, politics, and war? This course explores several facets of
this relatively unexplored but profoundly important aspect of human thought and
behavior.</span>

Title:  Everything is the Same: Modeling Engineered Systems
Short desc:  This introduction to engineering course will help you learn modeling and analysis techniques for electrical, mechanical, and chemical systems and discover how engineered systems that seem very different are actually very similar.  
Long desc:  Students
 in this class will learn modeling and analysis techniques applicable to
 electrical, mechanical, and chemical systems.  This “systems” view, 
that focuses on what is common to these different physical systems, has 
been responsible for much of the progress in the last several decades in
 aeronautics, robotics, and other engineering disciplines where there 
are many different technologies working together.  <br><br>Starting
 with algebraic descriptions of individual components (such as 
resistors), the class develops tools for modeling engineered systems.  Differential 
equations are key ingredients, so we will spend significant time 
learning how to derive differential equations from component descriptions. 
 One of the key ideas in this class is that electrical, mechanical, and 
chemical systems may seem very different from each other but often have 
very similar behavior, allowing us to draw powerful analogies between 
them.  Case studies from several areas of engineering will be used to 
illustrate the modeling techniques, including examples from robotics, 
power networks, exoskeletons, biomechanics, system identification, and active sensing.  Students will be encouraged to do hands-on 
experiments that demonstrate the techniques.  <br><br>

Title:  Fundamentals of Digital Image and Video Processing
Short desc:  In this class you will learn the basic principles and tools used to process images and videos, and how to apply them in solving practical problems of commercial and scientific interests.  
Long desc:  <p>Digital images and videos are everywhere these days – in thousands of
scientific (e.g., astronomical, bio-medical), consumer, industrial, and
artistic applications. Moreover they come in a wide range of the
electromagnetic spectrum - from visible light and infrared to gamma rays and
beyond. The ability to process image and video signals is therefore an
incredibly important skill to master for engineering/science students, software
developers, and practicing scientists.  
Digital image and video processing continues to enable the multimedia
technology revolution we are experiencing today. Some important examples of
image and video processing include the removal of degradations images suffer
during acquisition (e.g., removing blur from a picture of a fast moving car),
and the compression and transmission of images and videos (if you watch videos
online, or share photos via a social media website, you use this everyday!),
for economical storage and efficient transmission. </p>

This course will cover the fundamentals of image and video processing.  We will provide a mathematical framework to describe and analyze images and videos as two- and three-dimensional signals in the spatial, spatio-temporal, and frequency domains. In this class not only will you learn the theory behind fundamental processing tasks including image/video enhancement, recovery, and compression - but you will also learn how to perform these key processing tasks in practice using state-of-the-art techniques and tools. We will introduce and use a wide variety of such tools – from optimization toolboxes to statistical techniques. Emphasis on the special role sparsity plays in modern image and video processing will also be given.  In all cases, example images and videos pertaining to specific application domains will be utilized.<br><br>

Title:  Matemáticas y Movimiento
Short desc:  El curso propone un acercamiento a la Matemática Preuniversitaria donde el contexto del movimiento en línea recta dará significado al conocimiento y la tecnología será el medio para interactuar con el mismo.
Long desc:  <p>En este curso
vamos a considerar el contexto real del movimiento en línea recta para dar
cabida a ideas y nociones importantes del Cálculo. </p><p>El
curso se restringe al conocimiento de algunos modelos matemáticos con los
cuales quedará clara de un modo general la visión del Cálculo como la
Matemática que estudia el cambio y la variación. En este sentido, la idea de
derivada y su cálculo para diferentes tipos de funciones de una variable real forma
parte del curso.</p>

<p>A través del
análisis de diferentes tipos de movimiento realizados por un “personaje” sobre
una recta horizontal, la relación entre las gráficas de velocidad y de posición
del movimiento con respecto al tiempo, aparecerán ante nuestra vista como la
representación matemática que invita a interpretar lo que está sucediendo con
el movimiento en cuestión.</p>

<p>Algunos
conocimientos algebraicos y geométricos que corresponden con ecuaciones y
funciones lineales, cuadráticas y cúbicas van a ser retomados decididamente durante
el curso, y esto para dar respuesta a diferentes preguntas que surgen del
movimiento rectilíneo en cuestión.</p>

<p>Será de este modo que se podrá interactuar combinando las diferentes representaciones
matemáticas (numérica, algebraica y gráfica) en el afán por entender la
situación real considerada.</p>

<p>En este curso
se hará un uso pleno de tecnologías digitales para la graficación y de software
especializado en conocimiento matemático del cual se puede hacer uso de manera
libre en la actualidad. Las prácticas
que buscan consolidar el aprendizaje integran el uso de estos recursos también, brindando a la
vez la oportunidad de ver en la tecnología digital un aliado en la interacción
con la Matemática y nuestro pensamiento.</p>

El curso puede
considerarse como una preparación al Cálculo en el nivel universitario; no
obstante, busca ofrecer a cualquier persona un acercamiento a la Matemática
diferente, donde números, letras, fórmulas y gráficas se entrelazan en un
razonamiento coherente. Es una oportunidad para todo aquel que busca hacer del
razonamiento matemático una forma de pensar y actuar.

Title:  Introduction to Programming for Musicians and Digital Artists
Short desc:  This course provides a complete introduction to programming for digital musicians and
artists, in the real-time multimedia language ChucK. Rich with practical examples and
pointers to additional web resources, it can be understood by novices wishing to learn to
program interactive arts systems.   

Long desc:  <p>The course, lecture, and examples build on each other to teach the fundamentals
    of programming in general (logic, loops, functions, objects, classes) and
    also deals with advanced topics including multi-threading, events and signals.
     Throughout the course, students create meaningful and rewarding expressive
    digital “instruments” that make sound and music in direct response to program
    logic.  The ChucK language provides precise high-level control over
    time, audio computation, and user interface elements (track pad, joysticks,
    etc.).  ChucK is used (unknowingly in most cases, via SMule Apps)
    by millions of users throughout the world, and is the backbone of dozens
    of academic programs and laptop orchestras.  Learning to program using
    ChucK, through the musical examples provided in this course, will prepare
    students to program in C++, Java, and other languages. There will be special
    guest lectures from creators of the ChucK language, Dr. Ge Wang (Stanford
    University) and Dr. Perry R. Cook (Princeton University).</p>

Title:  From the Repertoire: Western Music History through Performance
Short desc:  This course will focus on eight important works from the Western classical-music repertoire that represent different eras and genres throughout history. We'll observe performances of this music recorded at Curtis, and our interactive discussions will explore each work’s historical context, musical significance, and compositional design.
Long desc:  <p>A survey of music history begins
with those works of music that convey the artistic trends, innovations, and
compositional techniques representative of their time. Rather than offer a
discussion of Western music focusing on a succession of composers, this course
will look at key works throughout history: from early music composed more than
one thousand years ago to music of our time. Through videos covering historical
context and recorded performances, students will learn how Western music has
developed throughout the ages into the rich and diverse repertoire that we have
today.</p>

<p><span>What makes this music truly special
and important? Distinguished members of the Curtis faculty will
provide their unique insights. Performances by Curtis students, alumni, and
faculty will enhance the learning experience by demonstrating the form and
design of the material in a creative<b> </b>and vital way. </span></p>

<p>By the end of the course, students should be able: </p>

<ul><li>to understand a general survey of the
development of Western classical music through the ages</li><li>to better understand each piece covered and to
develop the skills to do more research about these and other pieces<br></li></ul>

Title:  Exploring Beethoven’s Piano Sonatas
Short desc:  A series of lectures on one of the greatest bodies of music ever composed, from the point of view of a performer. Each lecture will explore a different facet of the music; all will attempt to locate the source of the tremendous psychological power of Beethoven’s music.
Long desc:  <p>
















</p><p></p><p>Our relationship to Beethoven is a deep and paradoxical one. For
many musicians, he represents a kind of holy grail: His music has an intensity,
rigor, and profundity which keep us in its thrall, and it is perhaps unequalled
in the interpretive, technical, and even spiritual challenges it poses to
performers. At the same time, Beethoven’s music is casually familiar to
millions of people who do not attend concerts or consider themselves musically
inclined. Two hundred years after his death, he is everywhere in the culture,
yet still represents its summit.</p>

<p>This course takes an inside-out look at the 32 piano sonatas
from the point of view of a performer. Each lecture will focus on one sonata
and an aspect of Beethoven’s music exemplified by it. (These might include: the
relationship between Beethoven the pianist and Beethoven the composer; the
critical role improvisation plays in his highly structured music; his mixing of
extremely refined music with rougher elements; and the often surprising ways in
which the events of his life influenced his compositional process and the
character of the music he was writing.) The course will feature some analysis
and historical background, but its perspective is that of a player, not a
musicologist. Its main aim is to explore and demystify the work of the
performer, even while embracing the eternal mystery of Beethoven’s music
itself.</p>

Title:  Conditions of War and Peace
Short desc:  This course aims to nail down some of the basic issues that had been argued in the current research on peace and security. 
Long desc:  <p>Discourse on war and peace has gone through a remarkable transition during
    the two decades after the end of the Cold War. We do not have to worry
    of major nuclear wars, and then, no longer can we anticipate stability
    based on nuclear deterrence. We have no immediate threat emanating from
    a belligerent adversary equipped with a major arsenal, but we observe a
    number of small to medium military powers that are more belligerent than
    the days of the Soviet Union. We have more democracies in the world, and
    yet are far from the democratic peace that has been imagined by the students
    of international relations.</p>
<p>This course aims to nail down some of the basic issues that had been argued
    in the current research on peace and security. The questions are all deceptively
    simple enough, but then the answers will all be ambiguous at best. It is
    my hope that you will be able to provide better answers than those given
    in the course by developing your own analytical capacity.</p>

Title:  From the Big Bang to Dark Energy
Short desc:  This course will cover various topics on the discoveries about how the Universe evolved in 13.7 billion years since the Big Bang. 
Long desc:  We have learned a lot recently about how the Universe evolved in 13.7 
billion years since the Big Bang.  More than 80% of matter in the 
Universe is mysterious Dark Matter, which made stars and galaxies to 
form.  The newly discovered Higgs-boson became frozen into the Universe a
 trillionth of a second after the Big Bang and brought order to the 
Universe.  Yet we still do not know how ordinary matter (atoms) survived
 against total annihilation by Anti-Matter.  The expansion of the 
Universe started acceleration about 7 billion years ago and the Universe is 
being ripped apart.  The culprit is Dark Energy, a mysterious energy 
multiplying in vacuum.  I will present evidence behind these startling 
discoveries and discuss what we may learn in the near future.<br>

Title:  Einführung in Computer Vision
Short desc:  Dieser Kurs vermittelt einen Überblick über die Grundlagen des Maschinellen Sehens an Hand der Extraktion von 3D-Information aus dem Stereokamerabild einer Szene.
Long desc:  <div>
    <p><span>Räumliches Sehen stellt für die meisten Menschen eine Selbstverständlichkeit dar. Maschinen mit einem gleichwertigen Sehvermögen auszustatten, ist hingegen eine sehr komplizierte Angelegenheit. Seit den 1960-er Jahren hat sich dieser als <i>Computer Vision</i> bezeichnete Forschungsbereich kontinuierlich entwickelt und zahlreiche Forschungsergebnisse hervorgebracht. Viele Fragen haben jedoch noch nicht hinreichend beantwortet werden können und sind bis heute aktuell.</span>

    </p>
</div>
<p>Dieser Kurs befasst sich mit einigen grundlegenden Algorithmen der Computer
    Vision, führt das hierzu benötigte Fachvokabular ein und frischt die benötigten
    mathematischen Grundlagen auf, wann immer sie benötigt werden. Beginnend
    mit grundlegenden Methoden der Bildverarbeitung wie z.B. der Kantendetektion,
    werden diese im Lauf des Kurses für umfassendere Aufgaben wie Merkmalsextraktion
    und Korrespondenzschätzung angewendet.</p>
<p>Diese Korrespondenzen können mit Wissen über die Darstellung von Bildern
    am Computer und der Beschreibung von Objektbewegungen im Raum dann verwendet
    werden, um die Epipolargeometrie eines Stereokamerasystems und somit die
    2D-3D-Beziehung zwischen Bildern und der Szene zu beschreiben. Hierbei
    wird der Unterschied zwischen unkalibriertem und kalibriertem Kamerasystem
    erläutert, sowie auf das Konzept der Homographie eingegangen. Schließlich
    ermöglicht das Zusammenspiel all dieser Aspekte die 3D-Rekonstruktion einer
    Szene aus einem Stereokamerabildpaar.</p>

Title:  Critical Thinking in Global Challenges
Short desc:  In this course you will develop and enhance your ability to think critically, assess information and develop reasoned arguments in the context of the global challenges facing society today.
Long desc:  Critical thinking is the ability to gather and assess information and evidence in a balanced and reflective way to reach conclusions that are justified by reasoned argument based on the available evidence. Critical thinking is a key skill in the information age, valuable in all disciplines and professions. <br><br> This introductory course will give you the opportunity to better understand what critical thinking is, and to practice and enhance your critical thinking skills. To do so, we will use the context of some important global challenges that affect us all, and to which we have no clear “correct” solutions: for example, the risk and spread of serious infectious diseases in epidemics in modern societies, the implications of increasing human population on global resources, energy, environment and climate, and the challenges of human health and wellbeing in the modern world. Possible solutions to global issues such as these are hotly debated, and give the perfect setting to practice recognizing and evaluating facts, ideas, opinions and arguments. <br><br> The relevant background information for each global challenge will be provided to ensure that you can complete the exercises. Note, however, this course is not a course on these global challenges themselves; instead it uses the context of these thought-provoking challenges to practice critical thinking.<br><br><b>Subtitles for all video lectures available</b>:&nbsp;Portuguese (provided by the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.fundacaolemann.org.br/" target="_blank">Lemann Foundation</a>), English<br>

Title:  E-learning and Digital Cultures
Short desc:  This course will explore how digital cultures and learning cultures connect, and what this means for the ways in which we conduct education online. The course is not about how to ‘do’ e-learning; rather, it is an invitation to view online educational practices through a particular lens – that of popular and digital culture. Follow this course on Twitter at #edcmooc.
Long desc:  <p>E-learning and Digital Cultures is
aimed at teachers, learning technologists, and people with a general interest
in education who want to deepen their understanding of what it means to teach
and learn in the digital age. The course is about how digital cultures
intersect with learning cultures online, and how our ideas about online
education are shaped through “narratives”, or big stories, about the
relationship between people and technology. We’ll explore some of the most
engaging perspectives on digital culture in its popular and academic forms, and
we’ll consider how our practices as teachers and learners are informed by the
difference of the digital. We’ll look at how learning and literacy is
represented in popular digital-, (or cyber-) culture, and explore how that
connects with the visions and initiatives we are seeing unfold in our
approaches to digital education.</p>

<p>This course will not be taught via a
series of video lectures. Rather, a selection of rich resources will be provided
through which you can begin to engage with the themes of the course. While the
teachers will be present in the discussion forums and in various other media
environments, there will be an emphasis on learner-led group formation, and the
use of social media to build personal learning networks and communities of
peers. On this course, you will be invited to think critically and creatively
about e-learning both as a process and as a topic of study; you will be able to
try out new ideas in a supportive environment, and gain fresh perspectives on
your own experiences of teaching and learning. &nbsp;This course is also intended to be an exploration &nbsp;of the MOOC format itself. &nbsp;Rather than approaching this course with the expectation of exacting teaching methods or precise learning routines, we invite all participants to collectively experiment with what the MOOC experience might be.</p>

<p>The course assessment will involve you
creating your own digital artefact: something that is designed to be
experienced digitally, on the web. It will be likely to contain a mixture of text,
image, sound, video, links, and can be created in the environment of your
choice. The artefact will be a representation of any of the themes encountered during the course, and you‘ll have
the opportunity to use digital spaces in new ways to present this work. Our
definition of ‘digital artefact’ is intentionally imprecise to invite
experimentation and creativity: it will be evaluated via guided peer-assessment.</p><p>This course has been developed collaboratively by a team of experienced teachers and researchers in online education, who run the international <a target="_blank" href="http://online.education.ed.ac.uk/">MSc in Digital Education</a> distance programme at the University of Edinburgh.<br></p>

Title:  Epidemiology: The Basic Science of Public Health
Short desc:  This course explores public health—both locally and globally—through the lens of epidemiology.
Long desc:  Often called “the cornerstone” of public health, epidemiology is the study
of the distribution and determinants of diseases, health conditions, or events among
populations and the application of that study to control health problems.
By applying the concepts learned in this course to current public health
problems and issues, students will  understand the practice of epidemiology
as it relates to real life and makes for a better appreciation of public
health programs and policies. This course explores  public health
issues like cardiovascular and infectious diseases – both locally and globally
–through the lens of epidemiology.

Title:  Metadata: Organizing and Discovering Information
Short desc:  Metadata is an unsung hero of the modern world, the plumbing that makes the information age possible. This course describes how Metadata is used as an information tool for the Web, for databases, and for the software and computing applications around us.
Long desc:  If you use nearly any digital technology, you make use of metadata. Use
an ATM today? You interacted with metadata about your account. Searched
for songs in iTunes or Spotify? You used metadata about those songs. We
use and even create metadata constantly, but we rarely realize it. Metadata
-- or data about data -- describes real and digital objects, so that those
objects may be organized now and found later.
<br>
<br>Metadata is a tool that enables the information age functions performed
by humans as well as those performed by computers. Metadata is important
to many fields, particularly Computer Science; but this course is not purely
a Computer Science course. This course approaches Metadata from the perspective
of Information Science, which is a broad interdisciplinary field that studies
how people create and manage information.

Title:  Equine Nutrition
Short desc:  This course will cover many aspects of equine nutrition ranging from anatomy and physiology of the gastrointestinal tract to dietary management of horses/ponies affected with nutrition-related disorders. 


This is course is designed for self-directed study with minimal tutor input, and as such emphasis is placed upon peer discussions of the topics presented in each section of the course.  This course is not designed to have a large amount of tutor input as this is an open access course that attracts tens of thousands of participants.  However, tutors will endeavour to answer the main queries relating to the understanding of the lecture materials and to provide a summary of the key questions raised in each of the weekly topics and clarification of any misunderstandings. 
Long desc:  This course is designed to provide knowledge of equine digestion and nutrition for those with an interest in this area. The anatomy and physiology of the equine alimentary canal will be studied to provide students with an understanding of the equine digestive system.  Nutrient sources for horses will be discussed, with emphasis placed on the health and welfare issues surrounding the inclusion of various types of feedstuffs in equine diets.  Students will also discuss recommendations on rations for horses and ponies performing various activities and should feel better equipped to make judgements on rations for horses and ponies, in health and disease.

Long desc:  This course will introduce you to some of the main areas of research in contemporary philosophy. Each week a different philosopher will talk you through some of the most important questions and issues in their area of expertise. We’ll begin by trying
to understand what philosophy is – what are its characteristic aims and methods, and how does it differ from other subjects? Then we’ll spend the rest of the course gaining an introductory overview of several different areas of philosophy. Topics you’ll
learn about will include:
<br>
<br>
<ul>
    <li>Epistemology, where we’ll consider what our knowledge of the world and ourselves consists in, and how we come to have it;</li>
    <li>Philosophy of science, where we’ll investigate foundational conceptual issues in scientific research and practice;</li>
    <li>Philosophy of Mind, where we’ll ask questions about what it means for something to have a mind, and how minds should be understood and explained;</li>
    <li>Moral Philosophy, where we’ll attempt to understand the nature of our moral judgements and reactions – whether they aim at some objective moral truth, or are mere personal or cultural preferences, and;</li>
    <li>Metaphysics, where we’ll think through some fundamental conceptual questions about the nature of reality.</li>

Title:  Understanding Media by Understanding Google
Short desc:  Few people who “just Google it” to find an answer to their every question understand just what the company does (and why). Through this course, you'll join the minority that really gets it.
Long desc:  <p>Google Inc. is one of the key success stories of the Internet era. The
    company has expanded beyond its original search business through innovation
    and acquisition to touch the lives of nearly every person who lives life
    online. Americans spend more than 3,400 hours per year using consumer media,
    the field where Google’s impact is most profound, and increasingly must
    understand what the&nbsp;company has wrought&nbsp;not only to control our
    offline and online environments, but also to interact and engage successfully
    with anyone in&nbsp;our&nbsp;professional and personal lives.</p>
<p>Students learn how to understand the tactics that modern media companies,
    journalists, marketers, politicians, technologists, and social networks
    are using to reach them and affect their behavior. They learn how to
    adopt strategies that put them on an even footing with these entities in
    achieving their own communications goals. They&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
    <li>think about, react to, and write about half a dozen important books about
        Google;&nbsp;</li>
    <li>read a sampling of newspaper and magazine reportage from Google’s entire
        history;</li>
    <li>monitor news sites and specialized blogs about the company and its competitors;</li>
    <li>take note of their own usage of Google and other online resources;
        and</li>
    <li>learn how to anticipate the future impact of the company and its competitors
        on information consumption, creation, and distribution.&nbsp;</li>

Title:  Understanding Einstein: The Special Theory of Relativity
Short desc:  This course offers you the opportunity to gain a deeper understanding of the life and work of the young Albert Einstein and especially his mind-bending special theory of relativity. 
Long desc:  In this course we will seek to “understand Einstein,” especially focusing
on the special theory of relativity that Albert Einstein, as a 26-year-old
patent clerk, introduced in his so-called “miracle year” of 1905. Our goal
will be to go behind the myth-making and beyond the popularized presentations
of relativity in order to gain a deeper understanding of both Einstein
the person and the concepts, predictions, and strange paradoxes of his
theory. Some of the questions we will address include: How did Einstein
come up with his ideas? What was the nature of his genius? What is the
meaning of relativity? What’s “special” about the special theory of relativity?
Why did the theory initially seem to be dead on arrival? What does it mean
to say that time is the “fourth dimension”? Can time actually run more
slowly for one person than another, and the size of things change depending
on their velocity? Is time travel possible, and if so, how? Why can’t things
travel faster than the speed of light? Is it possible to travel to the
center of the galaxy and return in one lifetime? Is there any evidence
that definitively confirms the theory, or is it mainly speculation? Why
didn’t Einstein win the Nobel Prize for the theory of relativity?
<br>
<br>Students may choose one of three approaches to the course: a more quantitative
approach, a more qualitative approach, or an auditing approach. The more
quantitative approach will include weekly problem sets, while the more
qualitative approach will include a creative project relating to the young
Einstein and/or the special theory of relativity.

Title:  Social and Economic Networks:  Models and Analysis
Short desc:  Learn how to model social and economic networks and their impact on human behavior.  How do networks form, why do they exhibit certain patterns, and how does their structure impact diffusion, learning, and other behaviors?   We will bring together models and techniques from economics, sociology, math, physics, statistics and computer science to answer these questions.  
Long desc:  <div>Social networks pervade our social and economic lives.   They play a central role in the transmission of information about job opportunities and are critical to the trade of many goods and services. They are important in determining which products we buy, which languages we speak, how we vote, as well as whether or not we decide to become criminals, how much education we obtain, and our likelihood of succeeding professionally.   The countless ways in which network structures affect our well-being make it critical to understand how social network structures impact behavior, which network structures are likely to emerge in a society, and why we organize ourselves as we do.  This course provides an overview and synthesis of research on social and economic networks, drawing on studies by sociologists, economists, computer scientists, physicists, and mathematicians.</div><div><br></div><div>The course begins with some empirical background on social and economic networks, and an overview of concepts used to describe and measure networks.   Next, we will cover a set of models of how networks form, including random network models as well as strategic formation models, and some hybrids.   We will then discuss a series of models of how networks impact behavior, including contagion, diffusion, learning, and peer influences.</div><div><br></div>

Title:  Bioelectricity: A Quantitative Approach
Short desc:  Nerves, the heart, and the brain are electrical. How do these things work? This course presents fundamental principles, described quantitatively.
Long desc:  <p>In this class you will learn how to think about electrically active
tissue in terms of individual mechanisms, and you will learn to analyze the
mechanisms quantitatively as well as describe them qualitatively. &nbsp;The
course uses many of the same examples used by Hodgkin and Huxley, who won the
Nobel Prize for their experimental unraveling of the mechanisms of the nerve
axon of the giant squid, and their creation of a mathematical model of
membranes and propagation to understand its function. &nbsp;That work has been
the foundational element of most subsequent understandings of electrically
active tissue, whether in nerves, the brain or in muscle, including the heart. 
</p>
<p>
In this course, topics include:
</p><ol>
<li>The electrical charging of active membranes from the creation and use of differences in ionic concentrations across the membrane.</li>
<li>The stimulation of the membrane, both naturally and from engineered sources.</li>
<li>The creation of action potentials by the membrane in response to stimulation.</li>
<li>The chain reaction of membrane responses, with each small region or cell initiating an action potential in adjacent ones.</li>
<li>The observation of associated electrical currents in terms of extracellular wave voltages they create, the basis of clinical measurements such as the electrocardiogram.</li>
</ol>
<p></p>
<p>
The course will at each step present equations and other quantitative reasoning so that you will be able to go beyond describing what happens qualitatively and be able to link together the phenomena in the mosaic in a quantitative fashion, which is essential to judging whether specific changes in inputs are important to the outcome. Through the use of quantitative analysis, you will learn that all the elements of the system are tied together and be able to link together and analyze the effects of one part on another.

Title:  Microeconomics Principles
Short desc:  Introduction to the functions of individual decision-makers, both consumers and producers, within the larger economic system. Primary emphasis on the nature and functions of product markets, the theory of the firm under varying conditions of competition and monopoly, and the role of government in promoting efficiency in the economy.
Long desc:  <h2>Why 3 Versions?</h2>

<p><b>Note</b>: In January 2014 we will offer 3 versions of this course so
    that you can choose a version that best meets your needs. Two of the versions
    are identical except for the duration of the course. The third version
    is both shorter and covers slightly less material, focusing on just the most critical
    aspects of microeconomics principles. See further below for more details
    about the differences.</p>

<h2>About the Course</h2>

<p>Most people make the incorrect assumption that economics is ONLY the study
    of money.  My primary goal in this course is to shatter this belief.
     In fact, in the last 50 years economists have tackled some of the
    most interesting and important questions for humanity.  For instance,
    the following are just a few examples:</p>
<div>
    <ul>
        <li>About Love and Marriage
            <ul>
                <li>Why is the divorce rate so high and what should we do in order to reduce
                    it?</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>About the Environment
            <ul>
                <li>Why do we have so much pollution?</li>
                <li>How much is an endangered species worth?</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            <div>About Crime</div>
            <div>
                <ul>
                    <li>Would legalizing marijuana lead to a reduction in crime?</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
        </li>
        <li>
            <div>About Labor Markets</div>
            <div>
                <ul>
                    <li>Does increasing the Federal Minimum Wage put people out of work?</li>
                    <li>Why did so many women enter the labor force during the last 40 years?</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
        </li>
        <li>
            <div>About things you should be worrying about</div>
            <div>
                <ul>
                    <li>Why is a college education a smart investment? Or isn't?</li>
                    <li>Why are the presidential candidates missing the point on college costs?</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
        </li>
        <li>
            <div>And about many other things:</div>
            <div>
                <ul>
                    <li>Would school vouchers lead to improvements in public education?</li>
                    <li>Why a draft would only damage the army?</li>
                    <li>How to level the playing field in baseball?</li>
                    <li>AND, why is COURSERA offering this course free of charge?</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
        </li>
    </ul>
</div>
<p>Additional questions we will consider:</p>
<ul>
<li>What economists do and the strange way they think? (Basic Concepts, Modeling and Trade)</li>
<li>What determines prices and quantity
    in a market economy? (Supply and Demand)</li>
<li>What is the relationship between
    free market economies and social welfare? (Market Efficiency and Government
    Intervention)</li>
<li>What are the distributional effects
    of taxes? (Elasticity and Taxes)</li>
<li>What is the relationship between
    production and costs in a firm? (Production and Costs)</li>
<li>How competitive firms choose their
    efficient level of output? (Competitive Output)</li>
<li>What are the pricing policies of
    firms with some degree of market power? (Firms With Market Power)</li>
<li>How much pollution is too much pollution?
    (Public Goods, Common Resources and Externalities)</li>
<p>We will be addressing many of these (and many more) questions
during this course. Again, my main goal will to show you the way economists
think and how to use this analytical system to answer questions related
not only to these and other important human issues but pretty much to anything
you end up doing with your life after this class. After all, as you will
quickly find out, I believe everything is economics!</p></ul>

Title:  Cryptography I
Short desc:  Learn about the inner workings of cryptographic primitives and how to apply this knowledge in real-world applications!
Long desc:  <p>Cryptography is an indispensable tool for protecting information in computer systems. This course explains the inner workings of cryptographic primitives and how to correctly use them. Students will learn how to reason about the security of cryptographic constructions and how to apply this knowledge to real-world applications. The course begins with a detailed discussion of how two parties who have a shared secret key can communicate securely when a powerful adversary eavesdrops and tampers with traffic. We will examine many deployed protocols and analyze mistakes in existing systems. The second half of the course discusses public-key techniques that let two or more parties generate a shared secret key. We will cover the relevant number theory and discuss public-key encryption and basic key-exchange.&nbsp;Throughout the course students will be exposed to many exciting open problems in the field.</p>
<p>The course will include written homeworks and programming labs. The course is self-contained, however it will be helpful to have a basic understanding of discrete probability theory.</p>

Title:  Heterogeneous Parallel Programming
Short desc:  This course introduces concepts, languages, techniques, and patterns for programming heterogeneous, massively parallel processors. Its contents and structure have been significantly revised based on the experience gained from its initial offering in 2012. It covers heterogeneous computing architectures, data-parallel programming models, techniques for memory bandwidth management, and parallel algorithm patterns.
Long desc:  <p>All computing
systems, from mobile to supercomputers, are becoming heterogeneous, massively
parallel computers for higher power efficiency and computation
throughput. While the computing community is racing to build tools and
libraries to ease the use of these systems, effective and confident
use of these systems will always require knowledge about low-level
programming in these systems. This course is designed for students to
learn the essence of low-level programming interfaces and how to use these
interfaces to achieve application goals. CUDA C, with its good balance between
user control and verboseness, will serve as the teaching vehicle for the first
half of the course. Students will then extend their learning into closely
related programming interfaces such as OpenCL, OpenACC, and C++AMP.</p>

<p><span><br>
The course is unique in that it is application oriented and only introduces the
necessary underlying computer science and computer engineering knowledge for
understanding. It covers the concept of data parallel execution models,
memory models for managing locality, tiling techniques for reducing bandwidth
consumption, parallel algorithm patterns, overlapping computation with
communication, and a variety of
heterogeneous parallel programming interfaces. The concepts learned in this
course form a strong foundation for learning other types of parallel
programming systems.</span></p>

Title:  Computational Molecular Evolution
Short desc:  In this course you will learn about how and why DNA and protein sequences evolve. You will learn the theory behind methods for building and analyzing phylogenetic trees, and get hands-on experience with some widely used software packages.

Long desc:  <div>This course is about molecular evolution - the evolution of DNA, RNA, and protein molecules. The focus is on computational methods for inferring phylogenetic trees from sequence data, and the course will give an introduction to the fundamental theory and algorithms, while also giving the student hands-on experience with some widely used software tools. Since evolutionary theory is the conceptual foundation of biology (in the words of Theodosius Dobzhansky: "Nothing in biology makes sense except in the light of evolution"), what you learn on this course will be relevant for any project you will ever do inside the life sciences. A phylogenetic tree will almost always help you think more clearly about your biological problem. </div><div><br></div><div>A special emphasis is put on methods that employ explicit models of the evolutionary process (maximum likelihood and Bayesian approaches), and we will explore the role of statistical modeling in molecular evolution, and in science more generally. A mathematical (statistical) model of a biological system can be considered to be a stringently phrased hypothesis about that system, and this way of thinking about models will often be helpful. In addition to model-based methods, you will also learn about other approaches, such as those based on parsimony and genetic distance (<i>e.g.</i>, neighbor joining). </div><div><br></div><div>Often, the evolutionary tree is the result we are interested in - knowing how a set of sequences (or organisms) are related can provide us with important information about the biological problem we are  investigating. For instance, knowing which organisms are most closely related to a newly identified, uncharacterized, pathogenic bacterium will allow you to infer many aspects of its lifestyle, thereby giving you important clues about how to fight it. In other cases, however, inferring the structure of the tree is not the goal: for instance, our main focus may instead be the detection of positions in a protein undergoing positive selection (indicating adaptation) or negative selection (indicating conserved functional importance). However, even in these cases, the underlying phylogenetic tree <i>will</i> be an important part of our hypothesis about (model of) how the proteins have been evolving, and will help in getting the correct answer. </div><div><br></div><div>Although the study of molecular evolution does require a certain level of mathematical understanding, this course has been designed to be accessible also for students with limited computational background (e.g., students of biology).</div><div><br></div><div>Topics covered:<br><br></div><ul><li>Brief introduction to evolutionary theory and population genetics.</li><li>Mechanisms of molecular evolution.</li><li>Models of substitution.</li><li>Reconstruction of phylogenetic trees using parsimony, distance based methods, maximum likelihood, and Bayesian techniques.</li><li>Advanced models of nucleotide substitution (gamma-distributed mutation rates, codon models and analysis of selective pressure).</li><li>Statistical analysis of biological hypotheses (likelihood ratio tests, Akaike Information Criterion, Bayesian statistics).</li></ul><div><br></div>

Title:  Introduction to Sustainability
Short desc:  This course introduces the academic discipline of sustainability and explores how today’s human societies can endure in the face of global change, ecosystem degradation and resource limitations.
Long desc:  <div>This course introduces the academic approach of Sustainability and explores how today’s human societies can endure in the face of global change, ecosystem degradation and resource limitations. The course focuses on key knowledge areas of sustainability theory and practice, including population, ecosystems, global change, energy, agriculture, water, environmental economics and policy, ethics, and cultural history.<br><br></div>
<div>This subject is of vital importance, seeking as it does to uncover the principles of the long-term welfare of all the peoples of the planet. As sustainability is a cross-disciplinary field of study, this foundation requires intellectual breadth: as I describe it in the class text, understanding our motivations requires the humanities, measuring the challenges of sustainability requires knowledge of the sciences (both natural and social), and building solutions requires technical insight into systems (such as provided by engineering, planning, and management).</div>

Title:  An Introduction to the U.S. Food System: Perspectives from Public Health
Short desc:  Explore how food intersects with public health and the environment as it moves from field to plate.
Long desc:  A food system encompasses the activities, people and resources involved
in getting food from field to plate. Along the way, it intersects with
aspects of public health, equity and the environment.  In this course,
we will provide a brief introduction to the U.S. food system and how food
production practices and what we choose to eat impacts the world in which
we live. Through several case studies, we will discuss some key historical
and political factors that have helped shape the current food system and
consider alternative approaches from farm to fork. The course will be led
by a team of faculty and staff from the Johns Hopkins Center for a Livable
Future.  Guest lecturers will include experts from a variety of disciplines,
including public health and agriculture.

Title:  Case-Based Introduction to Biostatistics
Short desc:  Learn to frame and address health-related questions using modern biostatistics ideas and methods.
Long desc:  The course objective is to enable each student to enhance his or her quantitative
scientific reasoning about problems related to human health. Biostatistics
is about quantitative approaches - ideas and skills - to address bioscience
and health problems. To achieve mastery of biostatistics skills, a student
must “see one, do one, teach one.” Therefore, the course is organized to
promote regular practice of new ideas and methods.
<br>
<br>The course is organized into 3 self-contained modules. Each module
except the first is built around an important health problem.&nbsp;The
first module reviews the scientific method and the role of experimentation
and observation to generate data, or evidence, relevant to selecting among
competing hypotheses about the natural world. Bayes theorem is used to
quantify the concept of evidence. Then, we will discuss what is meant by
the notion of “cause.”
<br>&nbsp;
<br>In the second module, we use a national survey dataset to estimate the
costs of smoking and smoking-caused disease in American society. The concepts
of point and interval estimation are introduced. Students will master the
use of confidence intervals to draw inferences about population means and
differences of means. They will use stratification and weighted averages
to compare subgroups that are otherwise similar in an attempt to estimate
the effects of smoking and smoking-caused diseases on medical expenditures.
<br><span><br>In the final module, we will study what factors influence child-survival in Nepal using data from the Nepal Nutritional Intervention Study Sarlahi or NNIPPS. Students will estimate and obtain confidence intervals for infant survival rates, relative rates and odds ratios within strata defined by gestational period, singleton vs twin births, and parental characteristics. </span>

Course ID:  970764
Title:  Globalization and You
Short desc:  This course offers an evidence-based analysis of globalization that addresses what is happening to us personally as well as economically amidst the market-led processes of global integration. 
Long desc:  <p>Particular attention is paid to the ways market-led macro-economic reforms
    associated with globalization (such as free trade agreements and privatization
    initiatives) have come together with much more micro innovations in how
    personal behavior is organized by market forces (rethinking education as
    a personal investment practice, for example, or outsourcing dating to for-profit
    companies).  Mediating between these macro and micro scales of capitalist
    transformation are a wide array of other market-based mechanisms examined
    in the course.  From bond risk ratings to the market metrics shaping
    FICO scores, personalized medicine and online mapping, these market-mechanisms
    require close examination. Tracing their influence with an awareness of
    their material geographic variation and unevenness, the course offers an
    alternative to economistic assumptions about choice-maximizing behavior
    on a ‘level playing field’. It explores instead the complex uneven development
    dynamics of globalization in ways that allow you to see how your own personal
    perspectives on these dynamics are at once outcomes and enablers of economic
    and social change.  And, by doing so, the course aims in turn at enabling
    you to be a more engaged participant in the ongoing debates over the direction
    these dynamics <i>should</i> take.  Key words that are debated, defined
    and/or explained in the course include: globalization, interdependency,
    discourse, capitalism, neoliberalism, value, financialization, harmonization,
    competition, governance, governmentality, power, citizenship, choice, accountability,
    enclaving, geopolitics, biopolitics, biocapital and global health.</p>

Title:  Internet History, Technology, and Security
Short desc:  What is the Internet? How was it created? How does it work?  How do we secure communications on the Internet?
Long desc:  The impact of technology and networks on our lives, culture, and society continues to increase. The very fact that you can take this course from anywhere in the world requires a technological infrastructure that was designed, engineered, and built over the past sixty years. To function in an information-centric world, we need to understand the workings of network technology. This course will open up the Internet and show you how it was created, who created it and how it works. Along the way we will meet many of the innovators who developed the Internet and Web technologies that we use today. <br><br>
<h2>What You Will Learn</h2>
After this course you will not take the Internet and Web for granted. You will be better informed about important technological issues currently facing society. You will realize that the Internet and Web are spaces for innovation and you will get a better understanding of how you might fit into that innovation. If you get excited about the material in this course, it is a great lead-in to taking a course in Web design, Web development, programming, or even network administration. At a minimum, you will be a much wiser network citizen.<br>

Title:  Model Thinking
Short desc:  In this class, you will learn how to think with models and use them to make sense of the complex world around us.
Long desc:  We live in a complex world with diverse people, firms, and governments whose behaviors aggregate to produce novel, unexpected phenomena. We see political uprisings, market crashes, and a never ending array of social trends. How do we make sense of it? Models. Evidence shows that people who think with models consistently outperform those who don't. And, moreover people who think with lots of models outperform people who use only one.
Why do models make us better thinkers?
Models help us to better organize information - to make sense of that fire hose or hairball of data (choose your metaphor) available on the Internet. Models improve our abilities to make accurate forecasts. They help us make better decisions and adopt more effective strategies. They even can improve our ability to design institutions and procedures. In this class, I present a starter kit of models: I start with models of tipping points. I move on to cover models explain the wisdom of crowds, models that show why some countries are rich and some are poor, and models that help unpack the strategic decisions of firm and politicians. The models covered in this class provide a foundation for future social science classes, whether they be in economics, political science, business, or sociology. Mastering this material will give you a huge leg up in advanced courses. They also help you in life.
Here's how the course will work.
For each model, I present a short, easily digestible overview lecture. Then, I'll dig deeper. I'll go into the technical details of the model. Those technical lectures won't require calculus but be prepared for some algebra. For all the lectures, I'll offer some questions and we'll have quizzes and even a final exam. If you decide to do the deep dive, and take all the quizzes and the exam, you'll receive a certificate of completion. If you just decide to follow along for the introductory lectures to gain some exposure that's fine too. It's all free. And it's all here to help make you a better thinker!<br><br><b>Subtitles for</b>&nbsp;<b>all video lectures available in</b>:&nbsp;Chinese (provided by&nbsp;<a href="http://coursera.yeeyan.org/" target="_blank">Yeeyan</a>),&nbsp;English,&nbsp;Ukrainian (<a href="http://pinchukfund.org/en/">Pinchuk Foundation</a>)<br>

Title:  Social Network Analysis
Short desc:  This course will use social network analysis, both its theory and computational tools, to make sense of the social and information networks that have been fueled and rendered accessible by the internet.
Long desc:  Everything is connected: people, information, events and places, all the more so with the advent of online social media. A practical way of making sense of the tangle of connections is to analyze them as networks. In this course you will learn about the structure and evolution of networks, drawing on knowledge from disciplines as diverse as sociology, mathematics, computer science, economics, and physics. Online interactive demonstrations and hands-on analysis of real-world data sets will focus on a range of tasks: from identifying important nodes in the network, to detecting communities, to tracing information diffusion and opinion formation.

Title:  Introduction to Sustainability
Short desc:  This course introduces the academic discipline of sustainability and explores how today’s human societies can endure in the face of global change, ecosystem degradation and resource limitations.
Long desc:  <div>This course introduces the academic approach of Sustainability and explores how today’s human societies can endure in the face of global change, ecosystem degradation and resource limitations. The course focuses on key knowledge areas of sustainability theory and practice, including population, ecosystems, global change, energy, agriculture, water, environmental economics and policy, ethics, and cultural history.<br><br></div>
<div>This subject is of vital importance, seeking as it does to uncover the principles of the long-term welfare of all the peoples of the planet. As sustainability is a cross-disciplinary field of study, this foundation requires intellectual breadth: as I describe it in the class text, understanding our motivations requires the humanities, measuring the challenges of sustainability requires knowledge of the sciences (both natural and social), and building solutions requires technical insight into systems (such as provided by engineering, planning, and management).</div>

Title:  Child Nutrition and Cooking 2.0
Short desc:  Learn the basics of child nutrition and how to make healthy meals for healthy children and families in version 2.0 of the "Just Cook" class.

Long desc:  Eating patterns that begin in childhood affect health and wellbeing across
the lifespan. In the USA, we are in the midst of a childhood obesity epidemic
that threatens to leave our children with a shorter life expectancy than
their parents. As processed foods become more readily available around
the world, other developed nations are beginning to follow suit. This course
examines contemporary child nutrition in America from the individual decisions
made by each family to the widespread food marketing targeting our children.
 The health risks associated with obesity in childhood are also discussed.
Students will learn what constitutes a healthy diet for children and adults
and how to prepare simple, delicious foods aimed at inspiring a lifelong
celebration of easy home-cooked meals. This course will help prepare students
to be the leading health providers, teachers and parents of the present
and future.

Title:  ICT in Primary Education: Transforming children's learning across the curriculum
Short desc:  Why and how are teachers integrating ICT (Information and Communication Technology) into primary education? In this course we analyse examples from schools in different parts of the world, and bring professional teachers, headteachers and policymakers together to share their best ideas and inspiring stories.
The materials in the course are based on studies carried out for the UNESCO Institute of IT in Education, Moscow.
Long desc:  <p>Teachers and policymakers working in all sectors of
education now recognise the importance and value of technology for learning and
teaching. The Institute of Education, University of London (IOE <a title="Link: http://www.ioe.ac.uk/" target="_blank" href="http://www.ioe.ac.uk/">http://www.ioe.ac.uk/</a> ) and the UNESCO Institute for IT in
Education (IITE <a target="_blank" href="http://iite.unesco.org/">http://iite.unesco.org/</a> ) are collaborating to run this professional development course
for teachers, headteachers and policymakers working in the Primary Education
sector.</p>

<p>The course is part of IITE’s role to support and promote an
active community of practitioners and policymakers in the use of digital
technologies for learning and teaching.</p>

<p>It is also linked to the IOE’s mission to promote excellence in education and
professional practice through advancing knowledge and understanding.  </p>

<p>The resources for the course are derived from teachers’ Primary
practice in different countries. The UNESCO IITE funded an international
project to collect practices, experiences, policies, cases and data from several
countries in different parts of the world. The outcome is two volumes
summarising the findings. The basis of the course is therefore not a
particular theoretical approach, but a collection of good and interesting
experiences and exemplars of ICT in primary education from across the world.
What unites all the authors and teachers involved in the project is our
conviction that ICT, used well, by good teachers, alongside other methods, can
enable every child to achieve their learning potential.</p><br>

Title:  Network Analysis in Systems Biology
Short desc:  An introduction to network analysis and statistical methods used in contemporary Systems Biology and Systems Pharmacology research. 
Long desc:  <p>The
course Network Analysis in Systems Biology provides an introduction to network
analysis and statistical methods used in contemporary Systems Biology and Systems Pharmacology research. Students will learn how to construct, analyze and
visualize different types of molecular networks, including gene regulatory
networks connecting transcription factors to their target genes,
protein-protein interaction networks, cell signaling pathways and networks, drug-target and drug-drug similarity networks and other functional association networks. Methods to process raw data from genome-wide
RNA (microarrays and RNA-seq) and proteomics (IP-MS and phosphoproteomics)
profiling will be presented. Processed data will be clustered, and gene-set
enrichment analyses methods will be covered. The course will also discuss
topics in network systems pharmacology including processing and integrating databases
of drug-target interactions, drug structure, drug/adverse-events, and drug
induced gene expression signatures.   </p>

<span>Half of the course will be devoted to describing major data resources and how these can be processed into networks, bi-partite graphs and gene set libraries for data reuse and integration. Special consideration will be made for the concept of research focus biases and experimental biases. The other half of the course will be devoted to analyses, including unsupervised clustering, data visualization techniques,
network topological properties, and gene-set enrichment analyses. The
course will be useful for students who encounter large datasets in their own
research, typically genome-wide. The course will teach the students how to use existing
software tools such as those developed by the <a href="http://www.mssm.edu/research/labs/maayan-laboratory">Ma’ayan Laboratory</a> at Mount
Sinai, but also other freely available tools. In addition the course
requires the students to write short scripts in Python and participate in </span>crowdsourcing micro-  and mega-task projects. The ultimate aim of the course is to enable students to utilize the data resources and methods they learn here for analyzing their own data for their own projects.<br>

Title:  Securing Digital Democracy
Short desc:  In this course, you'll learn what every citizen should know about the security risks--and future potential — of electronic voting and Internet voting.
Long desc:  Computer technology has transformed how we participate in democracy. The way we cast our votes, the way our votes are counted, and the way we choose who will lead are increasingly controlled by invisible computer software. Most U.S. states have adopted electronic voting, and countries around the world are starting to collect votes over the Internet. However, computerized voting raises startling security risks that are only beginning to be understood outside the research lab, from voting machine viruses that can silently change votes to the possibility that hackers in foreign countries could steal an election. This course will provide the technical background and public policy foundation that 21st century citizens need to understand the electronic voting debate. You'll learn how electronic voting and Internet voting technologies work, why they're being introduced, and what problems they aim to solve. You'll also learn about the computer- and Internet-security risks these systems face and the serious vulnerabilities that recent research has demonstrated. We'll cover widely used safeguards, checks, and balances — and why they are often inadequate. Finally, we'll see how computer technology has the potential to improve election security, if it's applied intelligently. Along the way, you'll hear stories from the lab and from the trenches on a journey that leads from Mumbai jail cells to the halls of Washington, D.C. You'll come away from this course understanding why you can be confident your own vote will count — or why you should reasonably be skeptical.

Title:  Grow to Greatness: Smart Growth for Private Businesses, Part I
Short desc:  This course focuses on the common growth challenges faced by existing private businesses when they attempt to grow substantially.
Long desc:  <div>Most entrepreneurship courses focus on how to start a business. Few focus on the next big entrepreneurial inflection point: how do you successfully grow an existing private business? This is the focus of this Course. It is based on the instructor's research and thirty years of real-world experience advising private growth companies.&nbsp;</div>
<div></div>
<br>
<div>This Course will challenge how you think about growth; give you tools to help you plan for growth, assess the preconditions to grow, and manage the risks of growth. You will study stories of how five different private businesses faced their growth challenges.&nbsp;</div>
<div></div>
<br>
<div>Growth, if not properly managed, can overwhelm a business, destroying value and in many cases even causing the business to fail. However, the research shows that every growth business faces common challenges. You can learn from others' experience—you do not have to "reinvent the wheel".</div>
<div></div>
<br>
<div>The Course format is case based. Each case tells a compelling story. You will learn from Julie Allinson, Susan Fellers, Dave Lindsey, Parik Laxinarayan and Eric Barger. In addition, each week, we will discuss a different content theme. In Weeks and 2 and 5, you will engage in Workshops where you will be asked to use and apply the Course tools and concepts to create growth strategies for two different real-life businesses. You will have the opportunity to create a Course Community of fellow-students to learn from each other as the Course progresses.&nbsp;</div>
<div></div>
<br>
<div>You will learn about the: "3 Myths of Growth"; the "Truth About Growth"; &nbsp;why growth is like "Mother Nature"; the "Gas Pedal" approach to growth; the all important "4 Ps" of how to grow; and how to scale a business strategically.</div>

Title:  Guinea Pigs, Heroes & Desperate Patients: The History & Ethics of Human Research
Short desc:  Learn about the ethical issues that arise when conducting human subjects research, as well as the history that grounds policies and debates in this area of biomedicine.
Long desc:  The objective of this course is to increase participants’ awareness and
understanding of ethical issues that arise in the conduct of research on
human subjects. The course will explore the history and future of ethical
and policy&nbsp;challenges using a multi-disciplinary approach. Leading
scholars in the ethics of human subject research will serve as course faculty.
&nbsp;This course will introduce participants to the history that grounds
policies and debates regarding the use of humans in research. It will continue
with&nbsp;discussion of&nbsp;how current international and US policies
governing research are applied, how ethical norms and concepts have evolved,
and how, in some cases, changes in research have outpaced changes in policy,
leading to an often complicated mismatch between the two.
<br>
<br>The lead instructor is&nbsp;Jeffrey Kahn, who&nbsp;is the Robert Henry
Levi and Ryda Hecht Levi Professor of Bioethics and Public Policy at the
Johns Hopkins University Berman Institute of Bioethics. &nbsp;He will be
joined by colleagues who are all among the leading scholars in aspects
of the ethical and policy issues related to research on human subjects,
including Profs. Ruth Faden (history and theory of informed consent),&nbsp;Nancy

Title:  Analytical Chemistry / Instrumental Analysis
Short desc:  If chemistry is the science of stuff, then analytical chemistry answers the question: what is it? And how much of it do you have? This course teaches how to do this with instrumental analysis! 
Long desc:  This course covers about a half a semester of instrumental analysis which is a standard part of the undergraduate chemistry curriculum. Any chemist has to understand how to analyze samples - whether they are water samples, blood samples or bits of a painting. Most often chemists do this using instruments of some sort. Machines like mass spectrometers or gas chromatographs can indicate both what's in a sample (qualitative) as well as how much of something there is(quantitative). If you are fascinated by shows like CSI, and have enough basic chemistry, this course would be great for you. However, the course is first and foremost designed for chemistry students working towards their degree.<br><div>Students who complete this class will understand that analytical instruments are not black boxes, but rather complex tools whose utility depends in detail on how analysts both configure and apply them. Towards that end there are three pimary objectives. First, students will learn facts about major classes of instruments commonly used in chemical analysis. Their knowledge will be captured by the ability to block diagram these complex pieces of equipment, and tailor the specifications to the measurement needs. Second, the course will cover the basics of instrumental calibration and quality control. Analysts will develop the ability to apply calibration curves, internal standards and the method of standard addition as needed for various measurement problems. Finally, students must learn how to select and tailor the best instrumental method given a particular measurement need. This higher level skill involves critical evaluation of the strengths and limitations of the various method, and the ability to understand the context behind a measurement need.</div>

Title:  Caries Management by Risk Assessment (CAMBRA)
Short desc:  This course will provide the scientific basis for caries (dental decay) risk assessment and practice interventions.  You will immediately be able to apply “caries management by risk assessment” into your clinical setting or into your personal health care.
Long desc:  Dental Caries (tooth decay) is a bacterially based disease that progresses
when acid produced by bacterial action on dietary fermentable carbohydrates
travels into the tooth and dissolves the carbonated hydroxyapatite mineral.
 This process is<span> called demineralization.<br>
<br>
Pathological factors, including acidogenic bacteria, salivary dysfunction, and
dietary carbohydrates are related to caries progression.  Protective factors, which include
antibacterials, salivary calcium, phosphate and proteins, salivary flow, and
fluoride in saliva can balance, prevent or reverse dental caries through a
process of remineralization. 
Remineralization is a natural and reliable repair mechanism for
non-cavitated carious lesions.<br>
<br>
This course will provide the scientific basis behind the “caries balance”
concept, which is the key to caries management by risk assessment in clinical
practice.  If pathological factors
prevail caries progresses.  If protective
factors prevail the caries process is halted or reversed.<br>
<br>
The course will present tools to implement  CAMBRA, “caries management by risk assessment,”
in your clinical setting.  It can be in
implemented medical and dental settings, and can benefit children and adults of
all ages. Implementation in dental practice provides patients with genuine hope
and success for the management of their oral health.  It is a practice builder for dentistry.</span>

Title:  The Science of Safety in Healthcare
Short desc:  This course will introduce the basic principles of the science of safety in healthcare.  Course content will be of relevance to members of the healthcare delivery team, including nurses, as well as the healthcare consumers in the general public.  
Long desc:  This course will introduce the basic principles of the science and culture of safety in healthcare. The goals for this course are to provide definitions and context of patient safety concepts and terms using a systems approach. We will explore foundation-level content in the science of safety, patient safety culture, teamwork, patient-centered care, and leading change. Students will also be introduced to strategies for identifying and mitigating risks through the use of human factors science and quality improvement methods. They will learn about the importance of using data to guide their change efforts, and about the use of the Comprehensive Unit-based Safety Program (CUSP) as one model to engage care teams—and entire organizations—in the effort to reduce preventable harm to patients. While course content and examples will focus on the acute-care healthcare setting, specifically the hospital, learning will be relevant to other healthcare settings such as extended care, outpatient, and home care settings. The content of this course has been adapted from the intensive five-day Patient Safety Certificate Program offered by the Johns Hopkins Armstrong Institute for Patient Safety and Quality as well as the Helene Fuld Fellows Program undergraduate course content from the Johns Hopkins University School of Nursing.

Title:  Introduction to Genetics and Evolution
Short desc:  A whirlwind introduction to evolution and genetics, from basic principles to current applications, including how disease genes are mapped and how we leverage evolutionary concepts to aid humanity.
Long desc:  Introduction to Genetics and Evolution is a college-level class being offered simultaneously to new students at <a target="_blank" href="http://biology.duke.edu/">Duke University</a>. The course gives interested people a very basic overview of some principles behind these very fundamental areas of biology.  We often hear about new "genome sequences," commercial kits that can tell you about your ancestry (including pre-human) from your DNA or disease predispositions, debates about the truth of evolution, why animals behave the way they do, and how people found "genetic evidence for natural selection."  This course provides the basic biology you need to understand all of these issues better, tries to clarify some misconceptions, and tries to prepare students for future, more advanced coursework in Biology.  No prior coursework is assumed.<br><br>

Title:  Computer Networks
Short desc:  The Internet is a computer network that millions of people use every day. Understand the design strategies used to solve computer networking problems while you learn how the Internet works.
Long desc:  Computer networks from ISPs to WiFi and cellular networks are a key part
of the information economy. These networks are the foundation for the Web,
and they enable companies such as Google, Facebook and Amazon. This course
introduces the fundamental problems of computer networking, from sending
bits over wires to running distributed applications. For each problem,
we explore the design strategies that have proven valuable in practice.
Topics include error detection and correction, multiple-access, bandwidth
allocation, routing, internetworking, reliability, quality of service,
naming, content delivery, and security. As we cover these topics, you will
learn how the internals of the Internet work to support the Web and other
networked applications. You will develop a detailed understanding of widely-used
networking technologies such as TCP/IP, HTTP, 802.11, Ethernet, and DNS.

Title:  Programming Languages
Short desc:  Investigate the basic concepts behind programming languages, with a strong emphasis on the techniques and benefits of functional programming. Use the programming languages ML, Racket, and Ruby in ways that will teach you how the pieces of a language fit together to create more than the sum of the parts. Gain new software skills and the concepts needed to learn new languages on your own.
Long desc:  Learn many of the concepts that underlie all programming languages. Develop
a programming style known as functional programming and contrast it with
object-oriented programming. Through experience writing programs and studying
three different languages, learn the key issues in designing and using
programming languages, such as modularity and the complementary benefits
of static and dynamic typing. This course is neither particularly theoretical
nor just about programming specifics – it will give you a framework for
understanding how to use language constructs effectively and how to design
correct and elegant programs. By using different languages, you learn to
think more deeply than in terms of the particular syntax of one language.
The emphasis on functional programming is essential for learning how to
write robust, reusable, composable, and elegant programs – in any language.

Title:  The Language of Hollywood: Storytelling, Sound, and Color
Short desc:  This Film History course explores how fundamental changes in film technology affected popular Hollywood storytelling. We will consider the transition to sound, and the introduction of color. This online educational experience is not equivalent to a college course. 
Long desc:  This history course explores how fundamental changes in film technology affected popular Hollywood storytelling. We will consider the transition to sound, and the introduction of color. Each change in technology brought new opportunities and challenges, but the filmmaker's basic task remained the emotional engagement of the viewer through visual means. We will survey major directors and genres from the studio era and point forward to contemporary American cinema. Our aim is to illuminate popular cinema as the intersection of business, technology, and art. Through film history, we will learn about the craft of filmmaking and how tools shape art.

Title:  Science, Technology, and Society in China II: History of S&T in Chinese Society
Short desc:  This course is the second in a trilogy of short courses. In this part, we apply some of the concepts we covered in Part I to study the development of science and technology in Chinese society, particularly in light of the influence the Industrial Revolution in the West has had on China’s technological development.
Long desc:  Having mastered in general terms some of the key concepts used in understanding
the relationship between science/technology and society, this course begins
to apply those concepts to China, historically and chronologically. Concepts
such as path dependency/lock-in effect, technological determinism and others
will be used to frame a narrative describing the emergence of science and
technology in Chinese society. This narrative will be heavily informed
by developments in the West during the Industrial Revolution so that we
can understand how that series of events affected the development of science
and technology in China. This part of the course will also lay the foundation
for <b><u><a href="https://www.coursera.org/course/stschina3">Part III</a></u></b>.

Title:  Science, Technology, and Society in China III: The Present & Policy Implications
Short desc:  This course is the third in a trilogy of short courses. In this final part, we integrate what we have learned in the previous two parts to investigate the evolution and implications of Chinese government policies designed to promote scientific and technological progress. Based on this, we will attempt to sketch a picture of the future of science and technology in China.
Long desc:  In this course, we examine science and technology in Chinese society today
as well as the basis for the policy prescriptions the Chinese government
is currently employing to promote innovation and technology development.
We will cover the impact of these policies on the efforts of Chinese companies
to enhance their global technological competitiveness. We will learn how
observers inside and outside China have come to regard the country as a
“technological superpower”, and analyze the extent to which this reflects
the actual situation today (and tomorrow).

Title:  Organizational Analysis
Short desc:  In this introductory course, you will learn multiple theories of organizational behavior and apply them to actual cases of organizational change.
Long desc:  It is hard to imagine living in modern society without participating in or interacting with organizations. The ubiquity and variability of organizations means there is ample room for complexity and confusion in the organizational challenges we regularly
face. Through this course, students will consider cases describing various organizational struggles: school systems and politicians attempting to implement education reforms; government administrators dealing with an international crisis; technology firms
trying to create a company ethos that sustains worker commitment; and even two universities trying to gain international standing by performing a merger.
<br>
<br>Each case is full of details and complexity. So how do we make sense of organizations and the challenges they face, let alone develop means of managing them in desired directions? While every detail can matter, some matter more than others. This is why
we rely on organizational theories -- to focus our attention and draw out relevant features in a sensible way.
<br>
<br>Through this course you will come to see that there is nothing more practical than a good theory. Every week, you’ll learn a different organizational theory, and it will become a lens through which you can interpret concrete organizational situations.
Armed with a toolset of theories, you will then be able to systematically identify important features of an organization and the events transforming it – and use the theories to predict which actions will best redirect the organization in a desired direction.<br><br>Join your future classmates and course alumni on&nbsp;<a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/219602578167354/" target="_blank" title="Link: https://www.facebook.com/groups/219602578167354/">Facebook</a>!<br>

The fundamentals of tinkering course provides research-based insights into design principles and learning indicators related to high-quality STEM-rich tinkering.  Classroom activities will involve electricity and magnetism as well as force and motion.
Long desc:  Tinkering is an age-old human practice that has recently been introduced
into the educational field as a potential driver of creativity, excitement,
and innovation in science learning. It is seen by many as an effective
means to engage students in exploring STEM concepts, practices and phenomena.
Tinkering typically blends the high and low tech tools of science along
with a strong aesthetic dimension that supports children’s self expression.
For over a decade, the Exploratorium has been developing science-rich tinkering
activities. Working with learning scientists, we have identified a set
of design principles and indicators of learning that can help you to integrate
tinkering activities into your elementary and middle school science programs.
This course will focus on key design elements of high quality science-rich
tinkering activities, facilitation strategies, and environmental organization. Selected classroom tinkering activities will involve electricity and magnetism as well as force and motion.&nbsp; Using a library of video exemplars, we will review the ways in which tinkering
supports students' science learning through providing opportunities for
them to deepen engagement, intentionality, innovation, collaboration, and
understanding. This course will excite you, inspire you, and get you and
your students tinkering in no time.<br>

Title:  Re-Engineering Your Science Curriculum
Short desc:  This is an Exploratorium Teacher Institute professional development course open to any middle or high school science teacher.  This course is designed to help science teachers infuse their curriculum with hands-on STEM activities that support the NGSS engineering practices.
Long desc:  This is a hands-on workshop that explores various strategies that middle and high school teachers can use to integrate engineering practices into science lessons and laboratory
investigations that they already do. We will start by comparing and contrasting the research methods employed by scientists and engineers, then demonstrate ways that teachers can facilitate, sequence, and assess lessons designed to help students understand and apply engineering principles. These principles include learning to (1) design within constraints, (2) analyze and interpret data, (3) construct models, and (4) conduct iterative tests. Upon completing this course, teachers will possess a deeper understanding of engineering and be able to effectively teach engineering processes to their students.

Title:  Effective Classroom Interactions: Supporting Young Children’s Development
Short desc:  During the early childhood years children gain knowledge and skills that provide the foundation for later learning. Young children learn many of these skills through the interactions they have with their teachers. This course is intended to increase teachers’ knowledge about specific types of teacher-child interactions that promote young children’s development. The course will focus on helping teachers to offer emotionally supportive interactions to the children in their care.
Long desc:  <p>When we look at the research about what teachers actually do each day
    that makes a difference in children’s lives, there’s clear evidence that
    it’s the daily interactions that teachers have with children that are most
    important.  And we know quite a bit about the specific type of interactions
    that lead to children’s development and learning.  So this course
    focuses on those interactions.  By the end of the course, you should
    have a deep knowledge and understanding of the types of interactions that
    foster learning and development among your students. <br></p><p>


















</p><p>Although there are many types of interactions that are critical to
young children’s development, this course will focus on one area in particular
– Emotional Support. </p>

<p>This course focuses on Emotional Support because it is really the
foundation of every early childhood classroom. In classrooms that are
Emotionally Supportive children and adults are comfortable with one another and
excited about learning. They look forward to spending time together and know
that, even when times are tough, there will be someone there to help them.






</p><p>What do you need to <b>know</b> to be a really effective early childhood
    teacher? Teachers need many types of knowledge – knowledge about children’s
    development, about the content they’re teaching, about effective teaching
    practices, about the needs and abilities of the children in their classrooms,
    and about themselves. In this course we’ll focus a bit on knowledge about
    children’s development and we’ll spend lots of time focused on knowledge
    about specific types of classroom interactions that promote learning and
    development.</p>
<p>Another part of effective teaching is <b>seeing</b>. All the knowledge
    in the world about effective teaching is only a piece of the puzzle. Good
    teachers need to see what effective teaching looks like – in lots of different
    types of classrooms, with lots of different types of children. Teachers
    tell us they don’t get nearly enough opportunities to see other teachers
    teach and they report how helpful these experiences are when they do get
    them. We’ll spend lots of time in this course focused on observing classroom
    videos and we’ll also ask you to spend some time watching yourself teach.</p>
<p>Ultimately we can’t learn to be an effective teacher without practice
    – we need to spend some time <b>doing</b> – enacting the teaching practices
    that we’ll learn about. Just as young children need to do things to really
    learn about them – you need to spend some time practicing the types of
    interactions we’ll be talking about.</p>
<p>There’s one last important element to being an effective teacher. Effective 
    teachers spend time <b>reflecting</b> on their practice. We think of this
    a bit like taking time to really look at your teaching through a magnifying
    glass – we’ll give you time to reflect on your teaching and what you have
    learned throughout this course.</p>
<p>Much of this course is based on the research of Drs. Robert Pianta, Bridget
    Hamre and many colleagues UVA and other institutions using the Classroom
    Assessment Scoring System – or CLASS(™). CLASS is an observational measure
    used in research and practice that defines specific elements of effective
    teaching. In this course you will see examples of the kinds of teaching
    practices assessed by the CLASS. And you will get opportunities to observe
    and analyze your own teaching practice in ways that have been shown to
    increase the effectiveness of teachers' interactions with young children.  </p><span>

Title:  Teaching Character and Creating Positive Classrooms 
Short desc:  Positive psychology meets K-12 pedagogy. This course explores key ideas of positive psychology and shows how great teachers apply those lessons to maximize student engagement and accomplishment.  Through lectures, discussions, interviews and footage of great educators in action, you’ll learn how to integrate character-based objectives into your own teaching.
Long desc:  Psychology, sociology, and neuroscience point to the existence of a set
of developable character strengths that serve as building blocks for positive
life outcomes. That’s why, in our view, character development and content
mastery act as the two complementary halves of remarkable teaching. But
they’re often perceived to be in competition. When you ask parents about
their goals for their children, they almost always respond with terms like,
<i>“successful,” “happy,”
“curious,”</i> and <i>“being kind to others.”</i> But when you ask schools
about their goals, they often reply in terms of academic content, like <i>“algebra,” “subject-verb
agreement,”</i> and <i>“the periodic table.”</i> 
<br>
<br>Great teachers have always united those two visions.
<br>
<br>This course explores the interconnection between character research, education,
and academic rigor. During our sessions, we’ll cover the field of positive
psychology as it relates to character strengths, as well as the concepts
of Growth Mindset, Constructive Responding, and Character Behavior Language.
We will engage with the existing research, hear from eminent scholars in
the field and top K-12 educators, and view footage of classroom teachers
integrating these ideas into their classroom instruction.
<br>
<br>The course will explore questions like:
<span>
<br>
<br></span>
<ol>
    <li>How can positive psychology help us maximize student engagement and accomplishment?</li>
    <li>What does it look like to implement a <i>growth mindset</i> in your classroom?</li>
    <li>Can you teach <i>grit</i> in the classroom? If so, how?</li>
    <li>Should an educator measure character? If so, how?
        <br>

Title:  Surviving Your Rookie Year of Teaching: 3 Key Ideas & High Leverage Techniques
Short desc:  Learn 3 high leverage ideas and techniques to thrive in your first (or fifteenth) year of teaching. 
Long desc:  Frustration. Hard Knocks. Sleepless nights. Tears.
<br>
<br>Those are just a few of the ways that rookie teachers describe their first
year in the profession. And those sentiments have been validated by countless
research studies that show that students, on average, learn significantly
less when they’re taught by rookies. Unfortunately, many educators believe
this is a necessary “rite of passage” – a sort of hazing that one must
experience on their path to effective teaching.
<br>
<br>We don’t believe that.
<br>
<br>Over the past 6 years, the Match Teacher Residency has developed and refined
an approach to specifically address the challenges that are unique to the
rookie teacher experience. In this four-week course, we’ll explore the
three ideas that we've found to contribute radically to success as a rookie
teacher.
<br><br><br><i>“It's been a fantastic learning experience. I've taken several Coursera courses and this one is definitely the most original and creative in its approach. I suppose its main advantage is the straightforwardness of teaching, clarity and impressive visual representation. Really looking forward to Part II, where rookie teachers may grow and develop their initial knowledge even further.”</i><br><p><i><br></i></p><p><i>“This was my first Coursera course and it was
really helpful, although I am a 12th year teacher. One can never say that
he/she can manage the class successfully every day, every hour. All the advise
was very much appreciated. Many thanks to all: Orin, Ross, and Kat. I await
your next steps!</i></p><p><i><br></i></p>

<p><i>“I am happy to report that it has come in VERY
handy in my subbing jobs, in not only helping get the classroom management
under control at the start of each period, but in keeping control for the rest
of the period.&nbsp; I even used it again yesterday, at another charter school
where I sub only occasionally, and where the students are also a handful to
manage.&nbsp; I know the regular staff noticed and saw the effects.&nbsp; So,
it seems I'm racking up points towards some good references when I do apply for
a permanent position!&nbsp; I have this course to thank for taking me from
being an ‘adequate’ sub to being an ‘outstanding’ one!”</i></p>

Title:  Common Core in Action: Literacy Across Content Areas
Short desc:  Learn how to apply some of the tools from the Literacy Design Collaborative to incorporate Common Core literacy standards into your content area. In this course you will explore Literacy Design Collaborative Resources, create a teaching task, and develop a plan to use the task within classroom instruction.
Long desc:  The Common Core State Standards are new and will challenge our students to show evidence of learning in new ways.  Instructional shifts are required, especially for teachers who must now incorporate literacy into content areas. Integrating the literacy standards can be difficult to do well. In this course you will have the support of a community and harness the power of collaboratively exchanging ideas with colleagues, as you design a teaching task (writing prompt) aligned with the Common Core.<br> <br>You will use a template from the Literacy Design Collaborative (LDC) to design a task that incorporates literacy into your content area and then create a brief plan for its use. These template tasks are a part of a much more in-depth LDC Module design and will serve to introduce you to the model and process.   <br><br>

Title:  Common Core in Action: Math Formative Assessment
Short desc:  This course offers participants an opportunity to engage in a community of learners using an inquiry cycle focusing on math formative assessments as a strategy for implementing CCSS in math. It focuses on the implementation of a Classroom Challenge: a 1 – 2 day lesson developed by the Mathematics Assessment Project (MAP) based on formative assessment and the CCSSM.
Long desc:  The Common Core State Standards in Mathematics (CCSSM) offer the opportunity for educators to transform teaching and learning by positioning students in more active roles as learners. In addition to explicit content standards (which describe what students will know), the CCSSM present a broad range of practice standards that describe ways that successful students in math demonstrate proficiency. What do students and teachers need to know to take on these standards? What does it mean, for example, for students to persevere through new and challenging problems, and/or critique the reasoning of other students, and how can their teachers best support them?<br><br>In the words of one math teacher, “it’s not the students’ job to figure out what is in our heads; it’s the teacher’s job to figure out what is in theirs.” Such an approach requires far more focus on formative assessment and deliberate strategies for teachers to pre-assess students’ assets, needs, and misconceptions – then move them forward while continually re-assessing. <br>

Title:  Foundations of Teaching for Learning 8: Developing Relationships
Short desc:  As a teacher you will need to establish appropriate relationships with many different groups within the school and the wider community. It is important for you to understand how critical these relationships are to student learning. 
Long desc:  <span>One focus of the
course is to help you develop strong relationships with families to enable them
to support children’s learning. Positive relationships with your students
enable you not only to teach them but also to get to know them as individuals.  Positive relationships with colleagues and
school leaders are necessary to help the school improve.<br></span><br>This course is part of the
Foundations of Teaching for Learning program which is designed to assist people
who are currently teaching but have had no formal teacher education improve
their understanding of their role and work as a teacher.  This set of courses will enhance your
knowledge and understanding about learning and teaching and what makes a
teacher a professional.  <br>

<p>Practical activities are provided to assist you in using what
you have learned to improve your teaching practice.  While these are optional, it is
strongly recommended that you undertake them if at all possible.</p>

Of particular importance is a guide to the development of a
portfolio to help you organize and document your thinking about what you have
learned. In addition, you may be able to use the portfolio to access other
opportunities in the future.

Title:  Coaching Teachers: Promoting Changes that Stick 
Short desc:  Learn and practice strategies for coaching teachers to make meaningful, long-lasting improvements in their instruction. 
Long desc:  <p></p><p>Teachers face a blizzard of decisions. Scholars estimate
that teachers have over 1000 unique exchanges with students every day, most of
which are unplanned and require quick decision making. And then there are the
myriad daily decision points related to curriculum planning, assessing student
work, and interactions with parents and colleagues. Amidst this frenzy, it’s
easy for “bad” habits to set in, and hard to break them once they do.<br></p>

<p>The question then becomes: </p>

<p><b><i>How in such a fast-paced environment can coaches
and instructional leaders help teachers execute changes in their practice that
actually stick?  </i></b></p>

<p>Effective teacher-coaches are not just knowledgeable about
instruction; they’re also highly strategic in their approach to changing
teachers’ behaviors. That starts with preparing teachers to receive critical
feedback, and then continues with a careful selection of goals and scaffolds to
ensure that feedback is implemented with fidelity. </p>

<p><span>Oftentimes, teacher coaching suffers from a lack of
direction, a lack of support, or both. The coach might tell the teacher to “Do
X,” but then fail to articulate clear, measurable steps for
implementation.  Most commonly, coaches
can be overly suggestive, telling the teacher “You <i>might</i> do X, Y, and Z,
and <i>maybe</i> even A, B, and C, too.” With an already very full plate, this
approach leaves the teacher uncertain of what to focus on first, undercutting
the likelihood of meaningful change. </span></p>

<p>Even teacher coaching that’s described as “good” can sometimes
fall short of resulting in meaningful change. The coach might see and say the
right things, and the teacher might be very appreciative of the feedback. But
unless the coaching drives true changes in behavior, the “good” in this case
could actually end up being the enemy of effective. </p>

<p>Match Education trains and employs dozens of coaches who
provide intensive support for teachers in Boston and New Orleans. Course
participants will be introduced to Match’s Five key principles of effective
coaching, which strike the right balance between providing clear direction for
teachers, while giving them the support they need to achieve their goals: </p>

<p>1)    
<b>Permission-based
Coaching</b></p>

<p>Teachers first need to permit themselves to receive
coaching in order for meaningful change to occur. A skillful coach needs to
know how to ask for and create buy-in for this level of permission. In this
session of the course, we focus on concrete strategies that help teachers
receive and process critical feedback, while maintaining a “growth mindset”
about their practice. </p>

<p>2)    
<b>Shared
Vocabulary and Vision</b></p>

<p>A teacher coaching relationship must begin with a shared
vocabulary for talking about instruction, and a common vision for what
excellent teaching looks like. In this session of the course, we introduce a
simple observation rubric and several video exercises that a coach could use
with a teacher to communicate the parameters of what s/he will be looking for
when s/he conducts classroom observations.</p>

<p>3)    
<b>Selecting
and Setting Measurable Goals </b></p>

<p>Novice teachers, in particular, often describe the feedback
they receive from expert coaches as akin to “drinking from a fire hose” –
there’s so much to work on that it becomes difficult to identify and prioritize
next steps for their practice. In this session of the course, we focus on how
to analyze classroom instruction and select a single, measurable goal that
addresses a particularly high leverage aspect of a teacher’s practice. </p>

<p>4)    
<b>Delivering
Directive Feedback</b></p>

<p>We believe that teachers need to leave a coaching feedback
session with absolute clarity about the steps they should take to achieve their
goals. However, the clarity of those steps could easily be obscured by a coach
who struggles to deliver candid feedback or to help the teacher articulate
concrete, actionable solutions. In this session, we introduce and practice a
protocol for debriefing a classroom observation that ensures that teachers have
the direction they need to successfully implement a coach’s feedback. </p>

<p>5)    
<b>Create
Opportunities for Practice </b></p>

<p>Great coaches don’t just leave it to chance that a teacher
is ready to implement feedback after merely discussing what to do. They first
try to create opportunities for the teacher to rehearse or apply the action
steps in the presence of the coach before the teacher attempts to do it in the
classroom. In this session, we explore different exercises for practicing
action steps within a coaching feedback session. </p><p></p><p><b>Course Learning Outcomes</b><br></p><p></p><p>o

Title:  On the Hunt for Feedback: Self-Directed Teacher Improvement
Short desc:  Take charge of your own improvement as a teacher by collecting and acting upon feedback. 
Long desc:  <p><b>On the Hunt for Feedback: Self-Directed Teacher Improvement </b></p>

<p></p><p>Teaching
is isolating. &nbsp;Most of the work happens behind a closed door.
&nbsp;Teachers want feedback about their teaching, but encounter three
problems:</p>

<p>1.
They don't get much. &nbsp;The principal or department head doesn't visit very
often. &nbsp;And there’s no built-in structure at their school for peer
observation. </p>

<p>2.
The feedback isn't helpful or actionable. </p>

<p>Sometimes
it's just happy talk -- 98% of American teachers are rated satisfactory -- and
while everyone likes a pat on the back, evaluations that say "you were
wonderful" don't make better teachers. &nbsp;Or sometimes the feedback is
critical in ways that don’t present clear next steps. &nbsp;Sometimes it's
vague or just plain wrong. &nbsp;</p>

<p>3.
Some teachers can be defensive. &nbsp;</p>

<p>(Yes,
we know – only SOME people are defensive, but not YOU. &nbsp;You are different.
&nbsp;You handle feedback with grace, confidence, and a "let's fix
this" orientation. {Except&nbsp;sometimes maybe not.}) </p>

<p>***</p>

<p>This
course is based on a simple idea: that teachers take control of their own
improvement by aggressively seeking out and acting upon feedback about their
teaching. </p>

<p><span>The
idea may be simple, but the work is not. So we should say straight up: <b>this
is NOT a typical MOOC</b>. Participants in this MOOC won’t improve their
teaching skills by just watching lectures. Participants also won’t really take
anything away from this MOOC if they do it “a la carte:” we believe they need
to do every part of every assignment in order to leverage the kinds of changes
in practice that we think are possible in a course like this. </span></p>

<p>We
all wish that our public school system was such that every teacher would have
easy access to great coaching – or even any coaching at all. But unfortunately that’s
not the world we live in. Indeed, high school athletes can EXPECT to be
coached, but schoolteachers somehow need to track it down themselves. Teachers
deserve better. But they have a choice: bemoan
the lack of legit coaching that they get and will likely continue to get, or
become the rare teacher who builds her own improvement loop. &nbsp;</p>

<p><b>Class
1: The Big Picture on Teacher Feedback</b></p>

<p>We
will review the realities of teacher feedback in typical schools, looking at
where that feedback usually comes to teachers and how it’s processed.&nbsp; In
most schools, the teacher plays a passive role in this—waiting until an
evaluation comes to them.&nbsp; We believe the best teachers create the
opposite type of process: they HUNT down feedback, drag it back to their lairs,
and use it. &nbsp;They realize that if they wait for good feedback to come to
them, they might wait a long, long time. &nbsp;</p>

<p><b>Class
2:&nbsp; Case Study: Peer Feedback</b></p>

<p>We
profile teachers&nbsp;who've&nbsp;asked their peers to give them critical
feedback. How did they ask their colleagues for help? What rubric or
observation protocol did they use? How did they choose what to focus on after
they got the feedback? What kind of action/improvement plan did the teacher
write? What happened when the teachers tried to implement their action steps?
What did their peers say when they came back to their classroom a few weeks
later? </p>

<p>Participants
in this course will do the exact same assignment: they will seek out feedback
from a peer to generate their own action plan and a reflection on its
implementation. Participants will also be assigned to give and receive feedback
on these action plans from other students in our MOOC who are working on
similar focus areas in similar contexts (e.g. other math teachers who are
trying to improve the rigor of their questioning). </p>

<p><b>Class
3:&nbsp;Case Study: Student Feedback</b> &nbsp;</p>

<p>First
we review the emerging new evidence, from the Gates Foundation MET Project,
about student surveys and their power for accurately assessing teachers’
strengths and weaknesses. &nbsp;Then, similar to the Peer Feedback class, we
show a teacher going through all the steps, interspersed with commentary from
the course instructor.</p>

<p>Again,
our MOOC participants will do the same assignment: create a student survey
(we’ll show you examples); administer the survey; tabulate the data; write and
implement a plan; and get and give feedback from/to a peer with a similar focus
area. </p>

<p><b>Class
4: Case Study: Assessment Data</b></p>

<p>First
we cover the evidence of how schools and teachers are using student assessment
data to drive instructional improvements. Then we once again examine examples
of teachers who go through all of the steps of administering a unit assessment,
analyzing the data, and designing and implementing a targeted instructional
intervention. </p>

<p>MOOC
participants will do the same assignment, and then get and give feedback
from/to a peer who teaches a similar subject and/or grade level. &nbsp;</p>

<p><b>Course
Learning Outcomes:</b></p>

<p></p><ul><li>To describe both structural and psychological
impediments to teachers receiving effective feedback about their practice, as
well as strategies to overcome those impediments.&nbsp;<br></li><li>To engage in self-directed improvement via three
types of data collection—action plan—reflection assignments: peer observation,
student surveys, and student assessment data analysis.<br></li><li>To provide critical support and feedback to fellow
MOOC participants who have similar teaching contexts and/or improvement focus
areas.&nbsp;<br></li></ul><p></p>

Title:  Student Thinking at the Core
Short desc:  This course explores how teachers can capitalize on what students bring to the classroom - their ideas, perceptions, and misunderstandings - to advance the learning of all students in the class, a practice we call “leveraging student thinking”.  
Long desc:  As good teachers know, our most important resource(s) in classroom interaction
are the ideas and experiences our students bring with them. The past two
decades of research on learning, and more recent framings of academic goals
(especially the Common Core State Standards) bring this insight to the
forefront. This short course, designed for as few as four weeks and as many
as eight, asks how teachers can and do capitalize on what students bring
to the classroom - their ideas, perceptions, and misunderstandings – to
advance the learning of all students in the class.
<br><br>Our overarching goal is to support participants in developing the knowledge
    and skills needed to take up student thinking in ways that enable all students
    to learn challenging subject matter – a practice we call “leveraging student
    thinking”.<br>
<p>Course content will focus primarily on middle grades classrooms in various
    disciplines, but the practice of leveraging student thinking is applicable
    to all subject areas and grade levels. Participants will explore the design
    of curricular tasks, the analysis of patterns of talk, and the use of representational
    tools to:</p>
<ul>
    <li>elicit student thinking,</li>
    <li>attend to significant features of that thinking,</li>
    <li>interpret students’ ideas within a developmental framework, and</li>
    <li>bridge from students’ current understandings to more sophisticated understandings.</li>
</ul>
<p>These ideas will be introduced through guided engagement with video cases.
    Analysis of the video cases will highlight the elements involved in leveraging
    student thinking, and also will illustrate the epistemic, academic, developmental
    and managerial “pressure points” that challenge teachers’ ability to capitalize
    on student thinking in constructive ways.</p><p>Throughout the course, participants will further explore and test out these ideas in their own classrooms, be they formal or informal. (A Sunday school class, a scout troop, a homeschool opportunity, or a traditional classroom environment would all be appropriate, but some kind of teaching practice is necessary to benefit from the course.)  The goal is to work on the work of teaching <i>while</i> teaching.</p><p>In addition, critical reflection with a group of partners is an important component of this course.  At key points, participants will be asked to document their work to share with peers for feedback. Therefore, we strongly encourage teachers to plan to work through this course in teams (of two to four people) to facilitate mutual observation, analysis and discussion. Teachers who do not have a team at the beginning of the course will be able to create a team through online forums at the beginning of the course and can exchange their teaching examples through video or narrative descriptions.</p>

Title:  Structure Standing Still: The Statics of Everyday Objects
Short desc:  The Statics of Everyday Objects is a course about how structures react to forces exerted on them while remaining unmoved.
Long desc:  <p>The Statics of Everyday Objects is a course about the world and
how it reacts to the forces acting on it. From suspension bridges holding up
miles of roadway, to sky-scraping buildings in the midst hurricanes, to huge
dams retaining billions of gallons of water in a reservoir, these structures
must withstand both the forces of nature and the forces that mankind has
intended for them. The analytical tools that designers use to create these
structures are deceptively simple, and it is the intent of this course to
explain things in a clear, straightforward manner.</p>

Title:  Engaging Students through Cooperative Learning
Short desc:  Founded in more than 25 years of research, this course will engage students in various forms of cooperative learning including STAD (Student-Teams Achievement-Divisions) which continues to empower students to work together to improve their understanding of mathematics concepts through a collaborative learning approach.
Long desc:  <p>Some of the
most powerful and widely applicable research-proven instructional practices are
those of cooperative learning, which are highly effective in engaging and
motivating students. When implemented correctly, such practices have been
proven to increase students’ achievement in a wide range of content areas at
all grade levels. Cooperative learning models will be explored to understand
the variables that differentiate group work from true cooperative learning,
including individual accountability and group rewards. The effectiveness of
student teams to support learning through peer motivation, peer assessment and
reteaching will be examined in depth.</p>

<p><b>Course Objectives</b></p><p></p><ul><li>Define the concept of cooperative learning and how it relates to
today’s learner.<br></li><li>Describe how cooperative learning works when there is individual
accountability, equal opportunities for success and team recognition built into
a task.<br></li><li>Describe the four theoretical perspectives of cooperative
learning.<br></li><li>Consider the impact of cooperative learning on 21st
century skills and meeting the cognitive demands of the Common Core State
Standards.<br></li></ul><p></p>

Title:  The Brain-Targeted Teaching® Model for 21st Century Schools
Short desc:  Improve the outcomes in your classroom through practical applications of neuro- and cognitive science research. 
Long desc:  <p>New findings from the neuro- and cognitive sciences have the potential to inform classroom instruction and influence educational practices for children at all developmental levels. &nbsp;Translating this research to practice, however, is often challenging for educational practitioners. &nbsp;This course will offer practical application of research by linking it with the Brain-Targeted Teaching® Model (BTT)—a pedagogical framework for using research in the neuro- and cognitive sciences as well as research-based effective instruction to guide teachers in planning, implementing, and assessing a sound program of instruction for all learners.&nbsp;</p><p>Participants in
the course will examine research from the brain sciences that can inform
educational practice and be able to implement research findings using the
instructional framework, The Brain-Targeted Teaching® Model. This model
presents six stages, or “brain targets” of the teaching and learning process.
The components include (1) establishing the emotional climate for learning, (2)
creating the physical learning environment, (3) designing the learning
experience, (4) teaching for the mastery of content, skills, and concepts, (5)
teaching for the extension and application of knowledge, and (6) evaluating
learning. A central theme of the model is the integration of the arts to foster
retention of new information, conceptual development, and higher-order thinking
and creative problem-solving.</p><p><u><b>Course
objectives:</b></u></p><p></p><ul><li>Describe themes in brain research that can inform
educational practice consistent with the Brain-Targeted Teaching® Model.</li><li>Describe how emotional and physical learning
environments affect learning.</li><li>Identify themes in brain research
that educators can apply as they design instruction; teach for mastery of
content, skills, and processes; design activities to apply and extend
knowledge; and evaluate learning.</li></ul><p></p>

Title:  Pattern-Oriented Software Architectures: Programming Mobile Services for Android Handheld Systems
Short desc:  In this course--the second in a trans-institution sequence of MOOCs on Mobile Cloud Computing with Android--we will learn how to apply patterns, pattern languages, and frameworks to alleviate the complexity of developing concurrent and networked services on mobile devices running Android that connect to popular cloud computing platforms. 

Long desc:  <p>The confluence of multi-core and distributed-core processors, inexpensive mass storage, ubiquitous wireless connectivity, and commodity software platforms is driving the need for&nbsp;software engineers and programmers&nbsp;who understand how to develop
    concurrent&nbsp;and networked software for mobile devices that connect to cloud computing platforms. Despite many improvements in processors, storage, and networks, however, developing quality software on-time and on-budget remains hard. Moreover,
    developing high quality <i>reusable
</i> concurrent and&nbsp;networked software apps and services is even harder. &nbsp;The principles, methods, and&nbsp;skills required to develop such software are best learned by&nbsp;attaining mastery of&nbsp;<i>patterns</i>, <i>pattern languages</i>,
    and <i>frameworks</i>.</p>
<p>

    A <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_design_pattern">pattern</a>&nbsp;describes a reusable solution to a common problem that arises within a particular context. When related patterns are woven together they form a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pattern_language">pattern language</a> that
    defines a vocabulary and a process for the orderly resolution of software development problems. A&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_framework">framework</a>&nbsp;is an integrated set of components that collaborate to provide a reusable
    architecture for a family of related apps or services. &nbsp;Frameworks can also be viewed as concrete realizations of pattern languages that facilitate direct reuse of detailed design and source code.</p>
<p>

    This MOOC describes <i>by example</i> how to apply patterns, pattern languages, and frameworks to&nbsp;alleviate the complexity of developing concurrent and networked&nbsp;software for mobile devices via the use of object-oriented design techniques,
    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_(programming_language)" target="_blank">Java</a>programming language features, and&nbsp;<a href="http://developer.android.com/" target="_blank">Android&nbsp;</a>middleware. An extended case study project
    will be used throughout the MOOC to showcase pattern-oriented software design and programming techniques&nbsp;for concurrent and networked mobile devices and clouds.</p>
<p><b>Note: This course is part of a trans-institution sequence of MOOCs entitled <a href="https://www.coursera.org/specialization/mobilecloudcomputing/2">Mobile Cloud Computing with Android</a></b>
</p>
<p>This MOOC and two others, taught by Dr. Adam Porter from the University of Maryland and Dr. Jules White from Vanderbilt University, have been designed to complement each other as part of the first trans-institution sequence of MOOCs taught on the Coursera
    platform, structured as follows:</p>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>The University of Maryland MOOC, <a href="https://www.coursera.org/course/android" target="_blank">Programming Mobile Applications for Android Handheld Systems</a>, will start on January 21st, 2014. It focuses on the design and programming of user-facing
        applications. &nbsp;</li>
    <li>The first Vanderbilt MOOC in the sequence, <a href="http://www.coursera.org/course/posa">Programming Mobile Services for Android Handheld Systems</a>, will start on April 2nd. It focuses on middleware systems programming topics, such as synchronous
        and asynchronous concurrency models, background service processing, structured data management, local inter-process communication and networking, and integration with cloud-based services. &nbsp;</li>
    <li>The second Vanderbilt MOOC in the sequence, <a href="http://www.coursera.org/course/mobilecloud">Programming Cloud Services for Android Handheld Systems</a>, will be start on June 15th, 2014. It focuses on how to connect Android mobile devices to cloud
        computing and data storage resources, essentially turning a device into an extension of powerful cloud-based services on popular cloud computing platforms, such as Google App Engine and Amazon EC2.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p>Some of the programming assignments and the course project for these MOOCs will be coordinated.&nbsp;
    <br>
</p>
<p>If you just want to take some of the MOOCs in this sequence or take them all in different order you’re certainly welcome to do so, and you’ll still learn a lot. However, if you take all the MOOCs in this sequence in the order presented you’ll gain a deeper,
    end-to-end understanding of handheld systems, their applications and services, as well as their integration into the cloud.</p>

Title:  Economics of Money and Banking, Part One
Short desc:  Introduction to a “money view” of economic activity for modern times, building on the intellectual traditions of British central banking and American institutionalism. Part One explores the economics of payment systems and money markets. Part Two explores connections with foreign exchange and capital markets.
Long desc:  The last three or four decades have seen a remarkable evolution in the institutions that comprise the modern monetary system. The financial crisis of 2007-2009 is a wakeup call that we need a similar evolution in the analytical apparatus and theories that we use to understand that system. Produced and sponsored by the Institute for New Economic Thinking, this course is an attempt to begin the process of new economic thinking by reviving and updating some forgotten traditions in monetary thought that have become newly relevant.<br><br>Three features of the new system are central.<br><br>Most important, the intertwining of previously separate capital markets and money markets has produced a system with new dynamics as well as new vulnerabilities. The financial crisis revealed those vulnerabilities for all to see. The result was two years of desperate innovation by central banking authorities as they tried first this, and then that, in an effort to stem the collapse.  <br><br>Second, the global character of the crisis has revealed the global character of the system, which is something new in postwar history but not at all new from a longer time perspective.  Central bank cooperation was key to stemming the collapse, and the details of that cooperation hint at the outlines of an emerging new international monetary order. <br><br>Third, absolutely central to the crisis was the operation of key derivative contracts, most importantly credit default swaps and foreign exchange swaps. Modern money cannot be understood separately from modern finance, nor can modern monetary theory be constructed separately from modern financial theory. That's the reason this course places dealers, in both capital markets and money markets, at the very center of the picture, as profit-seeking suppliers of market liquidity to the new system of market-based credit.<br><br><br>

Title:  The Fall and Rise of Jerusalem
Short desc:  Learn about Judah under Babylonian rule
Long desc:  The period of the demise of the Kingdom of Judah at the end of the sixth
century B.C.E., the fall of Jerusalem to the Babylonians, the exile of
the elite to Babylon, and the reshaping of the territory of the new province
of Judah, culminating at the end of the century with the first return of
exiles – all have been subjects of intense scrutiny in modern scholarship.
This course takes into account the biblical textual evidence, the results
of archaeological research, and the reports of the Babylonian and Egyptian
sources and provides a comprehensive survey and analysis of the evidence
for the history of this 100-year-long era. The course includes a detailed
discussion by Prof. Oded Lipschits of Tel Aviv University, with guest lectures
by leading scholars dealing with the archaeological and biblical aspects
of this debated topic.

Title:  What a Plant Knows (and other things you didn’t know about plants)
Short desc:  Can we say that plants have senses? You will learn how plants sense their environment and how scientists study plant senses. You will be exposed to both classic and modern experiments in plant biology, and may even start to question what defines us as humans.
Long desc:  For centuries we have collectively marveled at plant diversity and form—from
Charles Darwin’s early fascination with stems and flowers to Seymour Krelborn’s
distorted doting in Little Shop of Horrors. This course intends to present
an intriguing and scientifically valid look at how plants themselves experience
the world—from the colors they see to the sensations they feel. Highlighting
the latest research in genetics and more, we will delve into the inner
lives of plants and draw parallels with the human senses to reveal that
we have much more in common with sunflowers and oak trees than we may realize.
We’ll learn how plants know up from down, how they know when a neighbor
has been infested by a group of hungry beetles, and whether they appreciate
the music you’ve been playing for them or if they’re just deaf to the sounds
around them. We’ll explore definitions of memory and consciousness as they
relate to plants in asking whether we can say that plants might even be
aware of their surroundings. This highly interdisciplinary course meshes
historical studies with cutting edge modern research and will be relevant
to all humans who seek their place in nature. This class has three main
goals: 1. To introduce you to basic plant biology by exploring plant senses
(sight, smell, hearing, touch, taste, balance). 2. To introduce you to
biological research and the scientific method. 3. To get the student to
question life in general and what defines us as humans.

Title:  A History of the World since 1300
Short desc:  This course will examine the ways in which the world has grown more integrated yet more divided over the past 700 years.
Long desc:  This course explores the history of the modern world since Chinggis Khan. It focuses on the connections between societies from the time of the Mongol conquests and the gradual, but accelerating ways in which connections became ties of inter-dependence. The relations between societies are what will concern us. The forces pulling the world together vary from religious to economic, political to intellectual. These forces bring the world together, but they also create new divisions. Nowadays, we call this "globalization." That term has tended to emphasize the drive to worldwide integration; the view of globalization taken in this course emphasizes disintegration as well as integration. We will tackle some very basic questions: How do we explain the staggering wealth of China in the centuries up to 1750, as well as China's recent ascent? Where did the United States come from, and where is it headed? What are the significance and legacies of empire in the world? How have world wars and revolutions shaped the international system over time? What exactly is globalization, and how does today's globalization compare with the past? How has the relationship between humans and nature changed over the centuries?

Title:  Analytical Chemistry / Instrumental Analysis
Short desc:  If chemistry is the science of stuff, then analytical chemistry answers the question: what is it? And how much of it do you have? This course teaches how to do this with instrumental analysis! 
Long desc:  This course covers about a half a semester of instrumental analysis which is a standard part of the undergraduate chemistry curriculum. Any chemist has to understand how to analyze samples - whether they are water samples, blood samples or bits of a painting. Most often chemists do this using instruments of some sort. Machines like mass spectrometers or gas chromatographs can indicate both what's in a sample (qualitative) as well as how much of something there is(quantitative). If you are fascinated by shows like CSI, and have enough basic chemistry, this course would be great for you. However, the course is first and foremost designed for chemistry students working towards their degree.<br><div>Students who complete this class will understand that analytical instruments are not black boxes, but rather complex tools whose utility depends in detail on how analysts both configure and apply them. Towards that end there are three pimary objectives. First, students will learn facts about major classes of instruments commonly used in chemical analysis. Their knowledge will be captured by the ability to block diagram these complex pieces of equipment, and tailor the specifications to the measurement needs. Second, the course will cover the basics of instrumental calibration and quality control. Analysts will develop the ability to apply calibration curves, internal standards and the method of standard addition as needed for various measurement problems. Finally, students must learn how to select and tailor the best instrumental method given a particular measurement need. This higher level skill involves critical evaluation of the strengths and limitations of the various method, and the ability to understand the context behind a measurement need.</div>

Title:  Networks Illustrated: Principles without Calculus
Short desc:  This course serves as an introduction to the basic principles that govern all aspects of our networked lives. We will learn about companies like Google and technologies like the Internet in a way that requires no mathematics beyond basic algebra.
Long desc:  <p>Networks are
everywhere. From the social connections we make on platforms like Facebook, to
the technology behind the Internet upon which these sites run, they have become
an integral part of our daily lives.</p>

<p>In this course,
we will study these networks. Specifically, we will focus on understanding the
fundamental principles that guide their designs and sustainability. We will see
how the simplest phrases like “sharing is hard” and “crowds are wise” can
summarize a vast amount of network theory, that goes into answering questions
like “how does 3G work on your smartphone?” and “when can you trust an average
rating on Amazon?”.  And rather than using heavy math, this course will only
require basic arithmetic such as addition and multiplication. We rely on
animations, analogies, and anecdotes as our pedagogical tools, in lieu of
detailed equations.</p>

Title:  Moralities of Everyday Life
Short desc:  How can we explain kindness and cruelty? Where does our sense of right and wrong come from? Why do people so often disagree about moral issues? This course explores the psychological foundations of our moral lives. 
Long desc:  <p>How is it that we are capable of transcendent kindness—and
unspeakable cruelty? How do we make sense of people’s strongly-held opinions
about abortion, gay marriage, affirmative action, and torture? How do
evolution, culture, and religion conspire to shape our moral natures?</p>

<p>These are among the most important—and most exciting—questions
around, and they are the focus of this course. We will explore the modern
science of moral belief and moral action, drawing upon disciplines such as
cognitive science, neuroscience, economics, and philosophy. We will look at
research from the lab, from the community, and from the battlefield; we will
discuss babies, monkeys, and psychopaths; we will debate claims about moral
differences between men and women, liberals and conservatives, Christians and
Muslims. This course will cover prejudice and bigotry, sexuality and purity; punishment,
revenge, and forgiveness; and much much more.&nbsp;</p><p>

Title:  Programmed cell death
Short desc:  Billions of cells in the body die every day. How and why do these cells die? If you want to know the answers to these questions and if you also would like to know how scientists figured them out, this course might interest you.
Long desc:  <p>In this
course, you will learn about the conserved, molecular machinery that eliminates
cells through programmed cell death type I, also referred to as ‘apoptosis’.
Through apoptosis many cells are eliminated from our body during development
and throughout adult life, and deregulated apoptosis can lead to various
diseases such as cancer and auto-immune diseases. Rather than just telling you
about the molecular machinery of apoptosis and how it works to kill cells, I
will walk you through and discuss with you the critical experiments that led to
the discovery of the key components of this molecular machinery and the
mechanisms through which they function.&nbsp;I will also
discuss how apoptosis research can help to develop novel&nbsp;therapeutics
and consider the questions that remain open in
the field.</p><p>The course
will cover the following topics:</p>

<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Introduction
to programmed cell death and apoptosis</p>

<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The
BCL-2 family of proteins</p>

<p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Apaf
proteins</p>

<p>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Caspases</p>

<p>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Mechanisms
that regulate apoptosis</p>

<p>6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Non-apoptotic
functions of components of the central apoptosis machinery</p>

<p>7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Diseases
caused by deregulated apoptosis</p>

Title:  Sustainability in Practice
Short desc:  Sustainability is a practice operating across a variety of scales and skills. We will explore the ways that decision makers use systems analysis and design thinking to confront the career-defining challenges facing the next generation of  leaders. Networks of practice from across North America and around the globe will provide case material and guest lectures. 
Long desc:  <p>Sustainability is defining a generation of students and young professionals and their influence is transforming things like cities, companies, and laws around the world. Sustainability is often explained as meeting “the needs of the present without compromising
    the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.” In practice, this means understanding connections, including connections across time. These connections create systems that are greater than the simple sums of their parts, with consequences
    that are often unexpected by people paying attention to only one part of a system. This course provides an introduction to the ideas and practices that people are using to understand and change these connections in pursuing more sustainable processes,
    communities, environments, and organizations. </p>

<p>Systems theory appears in many guises and most disciplines claim some share of the systems approach to connections and consequences. In ways that we will explore in the course, design thinking is a method for putting systems theory into practice. Designers
    and their way of thinking provide a significant contribution to sustainability in practice, from improving energy performance in buildings to identifying the value ecosystems services provide to human settlements. This course has several strategic
    partners providing us with content and with platforms for discussion. These networks will provide the course with an extensive and diverse portfolio of problems, solutions, illustrations, and challenges with which to explore the ideas presented above.
    We will use these very different venues as platforms for discussion and will organize student conversations and assignments using the network partners.     </p>

Title:  Introduction to Mathematical Thinking
Short desc:  Learn how to think the way mathematicians do - a powerful cognitive process developed over thousands of years.
Long desc:  <div><b><i>NOTE: For the Winter 2014 session, the course website will go live at 10:00 AM US-PST on Saturday February 1, two days before the course begins, so you have time to familiarize yourself with the website structure, watch some short introductory videos, and look at some preliminary material.<br><br></i></b>The goal of the course is to help you develop a valuable mental ability – a powerful way of thinking that our ancestors have developed over three thousand years.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Mathematical thinking is not the same as doing mathematics – at least not as mathematics is typically presented in our school system. School math typically focuses on learning procedures to solve highly stereotyped problems. Professional mathematicians think a certain way to solve real problems, problems that can arise from the everyday world, or from science, or from within mathematics itself. The key to success in school math is to learn to think inside-the-box. In contrast, a key feature of mathematical thinking is thinking outside-the-box – a valuable ability in today’s world. This course helps to develop that crucial way of thinking.</div>
<div> <br>The course is offered in two versions. The eight-week-long Basic Course is designed for people who want to develop or improve mathematics-based, analytic thinking for professional or general life purposes. The ten-week-long Extended Course is aimed primarily at first-year students at college or university who are thinking of majoring in mathematics or a mathematically-dependent subject, or high school seniors who have such a college career in mind. The final two weeks are more intensive and require more mathematical background than the Basic Course. There is no need to make a formal election between the two. Simply skip or drop out of the final two weeks if you decide you want to complete only the Basic Course.</div><div><br><b>Subtitles for all video lectures available in</b>: Portuguese (provided by <a href="http://www.fundacaolemann.org.br/" target="_blank">The Lemann Foundation</a>), English<br></div>

Title:  Fantasy and Science Fiction: The Human Mind, Our Modern World
Short desc:  We understand the world — and our selves — through stories. Then some of those hopes and fears become the world.
Long desc:  Fantasy is a key term both in psychology and in the art and artifice of
humanity. The things we make, including our stories, reflect, serve, and
often shape our needs and desires. We see this everywhere from fairy tale
to kiddie lit to myth; from "Cinderella" to <i>Alice in Wonderland </i>to <i>Superman</i>;
from building a fort as a child to building ideal, planned cities as whole
societies. Fantasy in ways both entertaining and practical serves our persistent
needs and desires and illuminates the human mind. Fantasy expresses itself
in many ways, from the comfort we feel in the godlike powers of a fairy
godmother to the seductive unease we feel confronting Dracula. From a practical
viewpoint, of all the fictional forms that fantasy takes, science fiction,
from <i>Frankenstein</i> to <i>Avatar</i>, is the most important in our modern
world because it is the only kind that explicitly recognizes the profound
ways in which science and technology, those key products of the human mind,
shape not only our world but our very hopes and fears. This course will
explore Fantasy in general and Science Fiction in specific both as art
and as insights into ourselves and our world.

Title:  Internet History, Technology, and Security
Short desc:  What is the Internet? How was it created? How does it work?  How do we secure communications on the Internet?
Long desc:  The impact of technology and networks on our lives, culture, and society continues to increase. The very fact that you can take this course from anywhere in the world requires a technological infrastructure that was designed, engineered, and built over the past sixty years. To function in an information-centric world, we need to understand the workings of network technology. This course will open up the Internet and show you how it was created, who created it and how it works. Along the way we will meet many of the innovators who developed the Internet and Web technologies that we use today. <br><br>
<h2>What You Will Learn</h2>
After this course you will not take the Internet and Web for granted. You will be better informed about important technological issues currently facing society. You will realize that the Internet and Web are spaces for innovation and you will get a better understanding of how you might fit into that innovation. If you get excited about the material in this course, it is a great lead-in to taking a course in Web design, Web development, programming, or even network administration. At a minimum, you will be a much wiser network citizen.<br>

Title:  Model Thinking
Short desc:  In this class, you will learn how to think with models and use them to make sense of the complex world around us.
Long desc:  We live in a complex world with diverse people, firms, and governments whose behaviors aggregate to produce novel, unexpected phenomena. We see political uprisings, market crashes, and a never ending array of social trends. How do we make sense of it? Models. Evidence shows that people who think with models consistently outperform those who don't. And, moreover people who think with lots of models outperform people who use only one.
Why do models make us better thinkers?
Models help us to better organize information - to make sense of that fire hose or hairball of data (choose your metaphor) available on the Internet. Models improve our abilities to make accurate forecasts. They help us make better decisions and adopt more effective strategies. They even can improve our ability to design institutions and procedures. In this class, I present a starter kit of models: I start with models of tipping points. I move on to cover models explain the wisdom of crowds, models that show why some countries are rich and some are poor, and models that help unpack the strategic decisions of firm and politicians. The models covered in this class provide a foundation for future social science classes, whether they be in economics, political science, business, or sociology. Mastering this material will give you a huge leg up in advanced courses. They also help you in life.
Here's how the course will work.
For each model, I present a short, easily digestible overview lecture. Then, I'll dig deeper. I'll go into the technical details of the model. Those technical lectures won't require calculus but be prepared for some algebra. For all the lectures, I'll offer some questions and we'll have quizzes and even a final exam. If you decide to do the deep dive, and take all the quizzes and the exam, you'll receive a certificate of completion. If you just decide to follow along for the introductory lectures to gain some exposure that's fine too. It's all free. And it's all here to help make you a better thinker!<br><br><b>Subtitles for</b>&nbsp;<b>all video lectures available in</b>:&nbsp;Chinese (provided by&nbsp;<a href="http://coursera.yeeyan.org/" target="_blank">Yeeyan</a>),&nbsp;English,&nbsp;Ukrainian (<a href="http://pinchukfund.org/en/">Pinchuk Foundation</a>)<br>

Title:  Social Network Analysis
Short desc:  This course will use social network analysis, both its theory and computational tools, to make sense of the social and information networks that have been fueled and rendered accessible by the internet.
Long desc:  Everything is connected: people, information, events and places, all the more so with the advent of online social media. A practical way of making sense of the tangle of connections is to analyze them as networks. In this course you will learn about the structure and evolution of networks, drawing on knowledge from disciplines as diverse as sociology, mathematics, computer science, economics, and physics. Online interactive demonstrations and hands-on analysis of real-world data sets will focus on a range of tasks: from identifying important nodes in the network, to detecting communities, to tracing information diffusion and opinion formation.

Title:  Cryptography I
Short desc:  Learn about the inner workings of cryptographic primitives and how to apply this knowledge in real-world applications!
Long desc:  <p>Cryptography is an indispensable tool for protecting information in computer systems. This course explains the inner workings of cryptographic primitives and how to correctly use them. Students will learn how to reason about the security of cryptographic constructions and how to apply this knowledge to real-world applications. The course begins with a detailed discussion of how two parties who have a shared secret key can communicate securely when a powerful adversary eavesdrops and tampers with traffic. We will examine many deployed protocols and analyze mistakes in existing systems. The second half of the course discusses public-key techniques that let two or more parties generate a shared secret key. We will cover the relevant number theory and discuss public-key encryption and basic key-exchange.&nbsp;Throughout the course students will be exposed to many exciting open problems in the field.</p>
<p>The course will include written homeworks and programming labs. The course is self-contained, however it will be helpful to have a basic understanding of discrete probability theory.</p>

Title:  Plagues, Witches, and War: The Worlds of Historical Fiction
Short desc:  A unique and exciting introduction to the genre and craft of historical fiction, for curious students, aspiring authors--anyone with a passion for the past. Read classics of the genre, encounter bestselling writers of historical fiction, and discover your own historical archive while interacting with a global community of interested readers. 
Long desc:  <p><i>Plagues,
Witches, and War</i><span>
will provide an engaging introduction to the genre and craft of historical
fiction<i>.</i> You will learn
about some of the classics in the genre while encountering five established and
emerging authors of historical fiction (including a Pulitzer Prize winner and
several <i>New York Times</i> bestsellers) who
will be visiting our class as guest writers.</span></p>

<p><span>In Parts 1 and 3, I'll introduce the genre to you, and we'll read together from
a number of classic historical novels from England and the US: Scott’s <i>Waverley</i> (often described as the first historical novel), Charles
Dickens’s <i>A Tale of Two Cities</i> (set
in Paris and London during the French Revolution), William Wells Brown’s <i>Clotel</i> (the first novel in the African
American literary tradition, set in part around the time of Thomas Jefferson), and
several others. Given the length and complexity of these novels, lectures will
cover <i>selected excerpts only</i> while providing
an overview of the development of historical fiction during the nineteenth and
early twentieth centuries. We'll then move into the twentieth century, with lectures on modernism, metafiction, the mass market, and the New Historical Novel of Latin America. You should think of these parts of the course as
providing a kind of toolkit for your future reading in the genre. What
motivates certain writers to turn to particular historical moments, and what do
they hope to find there? What creative challenges do historical settings and
personages present to authors seeking to reimagine the past in fictional
narrative?</span></p>

<p>Guided by similar
questions, Parts 2 and 4-7 of the course will consist of a series of seminars on
the craft of historical fiction. These seminars will feature five novelists who
will be our guests for recorded workshop and discussion sessions as well as on-line forums
and chats with Coursera students. We are lucky to have an extraordinary line-up
of guest artists whose novels bring to life an array of past cultures, from
ancient Rome to Renaissance England to nineteenth-century Malaysia. We will
read selections from these authors’ novels along with some of the original
historical sources that inspired their fiction. During these sessions our
guests will discuss the process of research, the crafting of character,
setting, and dialogue, and the challenges of historical fiction as a genre,
among other topics. (See below for the list of guest
writers.) </p>

<p><span>Along with these
introductions to the genre and craft of historical fiction, you will have a
chance to research and, if you wish, begin crafting your own historical
fiction. All students will be assigned to identify either a local archive in their
immediate geographical area or a virtual archive on line. This archival
component of the course, which you’ll be encouraged to share in the forums, on the
course Facebook page, and over our Twitter stream, will expose you to a wealth
of historical materials inspiring your peers around the world. For those
wishing to attempt writing historical fiction themselves, an <i>optional</i>, <i>ungraded assignment</i> will allow you to post a brief piece of creative
work to be read and commented upon by your fellow students.</span> </p>

<p>Historical fiction immerses
us in the past in new and unexpected ways, even while teaching us much about
the present. I hope you’ll join me as we explore this immensely rewarding genre
and learn from some of its most talented contemporary practitioners.  </p><p>***</p><p><b><i>Here are our visiting writers, with links to their books and home pages:</i></b></p><p><a href="http://www.janealison.com/" target="_blank">Jane Alison</a>, Professor of Creative Writing at the University of Virginia, is the author of three novels (including <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Marriage-Sea-Jane-Alison/dp/B000J3EGJY/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1370529368&sr=1-1&keywords=marriage+of+the+sea" target="_blank"><i>The Marriage of the Sea</i></a>, a New York Times Notable Book for 2003) as well as a memoir, <i><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Sisters-Antipodes-Memoir-Jane-Alison/dp/B0058M9NFI/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1370529335&sr=1-1&keywords=sisters+antipodes" target="_blank">The Sisters Antipodes</a></i>.

Title:  The Modern and the Postmodern
Short desc:  This course examines how the idea of "the modern" develops at the end of the 18th century in European philosophy and literature, and how being modern (or progressive, or hip) became one of the crucial criteria for understanding and evaluating cultural change. Are we still in modernity, or have we moved beyond the modern to the postmodern?
Long desc:  <b></b>In this
course we shall examine how the idea of "the modern" develops at the
end of the 18th century in European intellectual history, and how being modern (or progressive, or hip) became
one of the crucial criteria for understanding and evaluating cultural change
during the last two hundred years in the West. We shall be concerned with the relations
between culture and historical change, and our materials shall be drawn from a
variety of areas: philosophy, the novel, and critical theory. Finally, we shall try to
determine what it means to be modern today, and whether it makes sense to go
beyond the modern to the postmodern.



<p><i>The Modern and the Postmodern</i> traces the intertwining of the
idea of modernity with the idea of art or culture from the late 18th
century until the present. Beginning with the Enlightenment, Western cultures
have invested heavily in the notion that the world can be made more of a home
for human beings through the development of culture (and technology).
Throughout this period there has also developed a strong, sophisticated
counter-movement that sees the Enlightenment effort as a disaster – destructive
of both art and of the world.</p>



<p>The
Western idea of modernity is linked to but not the same as the idea of
modernism. We will examine both in this class and then consider postmodernism
in relation both to the philosophical idea of modernity and to the aesthetic
considerations of modernism.</p>



This course covers a lot of ground,
historically, conceptually and aesthetically. There is much to read, and very
different kinds of reading: from philosophy to novels, from theory to poetry.
Not all students will like all the reading, but if you digest it all, you
should have a clearer sense of the cultural history of our present. 



<br><br>Students
should develop a historical, literary and philosophical understanding of some
of the key themes of modernity and modernism in the West. They should learn to
read classic and contemporary texts for their arguments, beauty and pertinence.
They should see why these texts are “good to think with,” and, it is hoped,
they will develop an appetite for further study in the areas covered by the
course.

Long desc:  <div>This course is designed to help students with very little or no computing
    background learn the basics of building simple interactive applications.
    &nbsp;Our language of choice, Python, is an easy-to learn, high-level computer
    language that is used in many of the computational courses offered on Coursera.
    To make learning Python easy, we have developed a new browser-based programming
    environment that makes developing interactive applications in Python simple.
    &nbsp;These applications will involve windows whose contents are graphical
    and respond to buttons, the keyboard and the mouse.
    <br>
    <br>The primary method for learning the course material will be to work through
    multiple "mini-projects" in Python. &nbsp;To make this class enjoyable,
    these projects will include building fun games such as Pong, Blackjack,
    and Asteroids. &nbsp;When you’ve finished our course, we can’t promise
    that you will be a professional programmer, but we think that you will
    learn a lot about programming in Python and have fun while you’re doing
    it.</div>

Title:  Introduction to Music Production
Short desc:  Learn about the music production process—including recording, editing, and mixing—and the tools available to you to create contemporary music on your computer. 
Long desc:  With the recent introduction of high-quality-low-cost software and hardware, the tools of music production are now available to the masses. Albums are made in bedrooms as well as studios. On the surface this is liberating. Anyone can make an album for the low cost of a couple pieces of gear and a software package. But, if you dig deeper, you will find that it is not so easy. Producing music requires knowledge, <b></b>dedication, and creativity.<br>    <br>Knowledge is where this course comes in. No matter what kind of music you are making, there is a large set of tools that you will need to use.  Each lesson of this course will demonstrate a different set of music production tools, loosely following along the music production process of recording, editing, and mixing. <br><br>We will start with some background on the nature of sound and how we perceive it. We will then examine the components necessary to record audio into a computer, so that you understand the devices that sound must travel through in a music production process. <br>    <br>Once recorded, sound must be organized along a timeline, a process known as editing. It allows us to give the impression of perfect performances and create many of the sounds we hear in contemporary music. The contemporary editing tool is the Digital Audio Workstation (DAW),  a piece of software that stores and organizes all the assets of a musical project. We will focus on the editing tools that are essential in contemporary music production and that all DAWs provide. <br><br>After editing, sounds must be combined or mixed together, so we look to the mixing board—a very creative place if you know how to use it. We will explore the basic functionality of both hardware and software mixing boards, including volume, pan, mute, solo, busses, inserts, sends, and submixes. The mixing process, however, includes more tools than the mixing board provides on its own. Sound must also be processed, modified from its recorded state to fit the context of the music. We will look at compression, equalization, and delay, and examine the many audio effects that are offshoots of these devices and how they are used in a musical context.<br>    <br>We will then explore the synthesizer, a major tool within the production of contemporary music. Yes, great music can and will be created without the synthesizer, but learning how a synthesizer works will give you a language to describe sound. Music is a collaborative art form, so there is nothing more powerful than effective communication. <br>    <br>In the end, the music production process relies on your creativity. Creativity is a product of the mind and will stay there, unexpressed, until the right tools are used in the right way to share it with the world. If you have an idea in your head, it will take numerous steps, each with an important tool, to reach your audience. You bring the dedication and creativity, and this course will bring you the knowledge to make that happen.<br>

emotions. If you have, you’ll look at your process differently, taking control
of aspects of the process you may have not noticed.<br><br>The course will start by examining the tools available to you, all
revolving around the essential concept of <i>prosody</i>. You’ll learn to use your
tools to enhance your message—to work compositionally at the same time you’re
developing your ideas.<br><br>You’ll be working both lyrically and musically, though
musically it’s not necessary that you either read music or play an instrument.
If you play, great, and you’ll be encouraged to play and record your musical
responses to the assignments. If you don’t play, the course offers you a number
of musical loops to work with. All you’ll have to do is sing your melodies over
the loops.<br><br>Assignments will ask you to post something for peer review—sometimes lyric lines or sections, sometimes
melodies, sometimes both. None of it has to be polished. The course is about writing,
not performing.<br><br>Most important, you’ll have a lot of fun.

Title:  Analysis of a Complex Kind
Short desc:  In this course we’ll explore complex analysis, complex dynamics, and some applications of these topics. 

Long desc:  Complex analysis is the study of functions that live in the complex plane, i.e. functions that have complex arguments and complex outputs. In order to study the behavior of such functions we’ll need to first understand the basic objects involved, namely the complex numbers. We’ll begin with some history: When and why were complex numbers invented? Was it the need for a solution of the equation x^2 = -1 that brought the field of complex analysis into being, or were there other reasons? Once we’ve answered these questions we’ll devote some time to learn about basic properties of complex numbers that will make it possible for us to use them in more advanced settings later on. We will learn how to do basic algebra with these numbers, how they behave in limiting processes, etc. These facts enable us to begin the study of complex functions, and at this point we can already understand the basics about the construction of the Mandelbrot set and Julia sets (if you have never heard of 
these that’s quite alright, but do look at 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandelbrot_set" title="Link: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandelbrot_set">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandelbrot_set</a> for example to see some 
beautiful pictures).<br><br>When studying functions we are often interested in their local behavior, more specifically, in how functions change as their argument changes. This leads us to studying complex differentiation – a more powerful concept than that which we learned in calculus. Don’t worry! We’ll help you remember facts from calculus in case you have forgotten.&nbsp; After this exploration we will be ready to meet the main players: analytic functions. These are functions that possess complex derivatives in lots of places, a fact which endows these functions with some of the most beautiful properties mathematics has to offer. We’ll explore these properties! <br><br>Who would want to differentiate without being able to undo it? Clearly we’ll have to learn about integration as well. But we are in the complex plane, so what are the objects we’ll integrate over? Curves! We’ll study these as well, and we’ll tie everything together via Cauchy’s beautiful and all encompassing integral theorem and formula.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br><br>Throughout this course we'll tell you about some of the major theorems in the field (even if we won't be able to go into depth about them) as well as some outstanding conjectures. <br>

Title:  The Ancient Greeks
Short desc:  This is a survey of ancient Greek history from the Bronze Age to the death of Socrates in 399 BCE. Along with studying the most important events and personalities, we will consider broader issues such as political and cultural values and methods of historical interpretation. 
Long desc:  This course is a survey of ancient Greek history, covering the roughly
13 centuries that extended from the Minoan / Mycenaean Bronze Age (ca.
1800-1200 BCE) down to the death of Socrates in 399 BCE.  Along with
studying the most important events and personalities, we will consider
broader issues such as political and cultural values and methods of historical
interpretation.
<br>Some of the topics we will cover include: relations between the Greeks
and their neighbors to the East; Homer and the heroic ideal; the development
of the type of community called the "polis"; the diffusion of Greek civilization
from Southern Italy to the shores of the Black Sea; gods and mortals in
myth, religion and ritual; the roles of women; Athenian drama; the treatment
of slaves and foreigners; and the birth and evolution of democracy. We
will strive to get as full an understanding as we can of this extraordinary,
and extraordinarily influential, society.
<br>
<br>Almost all the reading assignments are from ancient sources in translation.
No previous knowledge of ancient history is assumed.

Title:  9/11 and Its Aftermath -- Part I
Short desc:  This course will explore the forces that led to the 9/11 attacks and the policies the United States adopted in response. We will examine the phenomenon of modern terrorism, the development of the al Qai'da ideology, and the process by which individuals radicalize towards violence. 
Long desc:  The attacks of September 11, 2001, were a seminal moment in modern history. They demonstrated the ability of non-state actors to inflict serious damage on the world's greatest superpower and exposed the vulnerability of the entire global community to catastrophic acts of terrorism. <br><br>To understand the causes of the attacks, <b>9/11 and Its Aftermath -- Part I </b>will examine the phenomenon of terrorism, in general, and, more specifically, the radical ideology developed and propagated by Osama bin Laden through al Qai'da. We will consider why individuals are attracted to this ideology and how they radicalize to violence. We will also explore the way in which the United States addressed terrorism prior to 9/11 and the policy challenges it (and its allies around the globe) faced in the immediate aftermath of the attacks. <br><br>The second part of this course -- to be offered sometime in 2014 -- will examine the policy "aftermath" of 9/11. <b>Part II </b>will examine how the United States changed its policies in response to 9/11 in three areas: the use of military force, law enforcement and intelligence activities, and homeland security. We will trace the evolution of these policies from the Bush to the Obama Administration and critically assess the overall counter-terrorism strategy.&nbsp;<br><br>Together, these courses will provide the background necessary to understand why 9/11 occurred, and consider the range of options that democratic nations can use to counteract this form of political violence. &nbsp;

 <span><span>
  <span>
  <p><span>The Scientific and
  Engineering Practices as outlined in <i>A
  Framework for K-12 Science Education</i>, released by the National Research
  Council provides the basis for students to gain a deeper understanding
  science content through the use of hands-on science investigations and
  engineering design activities.&nbsp; Often
  these remain as engaging activities without adding depth to the students’
  understanding of the science core ideas. Research-based instructional
  strategies utilized in STEM programs require a more rigorous approach to
  describing the scientific ideas that underlie the activity.&nbsp; </span><b></b></p>
  </span>
  
  
  
 </span>
 
  
  
 
 
  
  
 
 <span>
  <span>
  <p>The question becomes: </p>
  <p><b>As
  teachers begin to address the Science Core Disciplinary Ideas through the
  lens of STEM (Science, Engineering, Technology and Mathematics) instructional
  strategies, how and why should the Scientific and Engineering Design
  Practices be integrated into investigations?</b></p>
  </span>
  
  
  
 </span>
 <span>
  <span>
  <p>Using the Framework for K-12
  Science Education can be the basis for this depth of understanding by:</p>
  <p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Providing
  research-based science core disciplinary ideas</p>
  <p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Connecting
  the ideas with Cross-cutting concepts</p>
  <p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Utilizing
  scientific and engineering practices and </p>
  <p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Providing
  guidance in the assessment of the depth of knowledge gained by students and a
  measure of achievement in understanding the core disciplinary ideas in
  science.</p>

Title:  Principles of Public Health
Short desc:  Principles of Public Health introduces the major concepts and principles of public health and the determinants of health status in communities. Emphasizes the ecological model that focuses on the linkages and relationships among multiple natural and social determinants affecting health.
Long desc:  <p>Principles of Public Health&nbsp;introduces the major concepts of public health and the
determinants of health status in communities. The course emphasizes the
ecological model that focuses on the linkages and relationships among multiple
natural and social determinants affecting health. As a relative concept, the
health of populations is assessed through comparisons of temporal, spatial, and
demographic dimensions of disease burden. The goal of public health is to
understand why and how different populations carry different kinds and amounts
of disease burden, and to use that knowledge for improving health by preventing
disease.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Students in the course will explore successful examples in
public health, including how scientific discoveries and regulatory policies
have both contributed to mitigate risk factors and improve health outcomes. How
socioeconomic and cultural factors modify the effectiveness of risk
intervention and disease prevention strategies. How individual actions and
collective initiatives play important roles in determining the status of
health. In addition, how the various methodological approaches that guide
discoveries in public health have been applied from the local scale to the
global level.</p>

Title:  Economics of Money and Banking, Part Two
Short desc:  Introduction to a “money view” of economic activity for modern times, building on the intellectual traditions of British central banking and American institutionalism. Part One explores the economics of payment systems and money markets. Part Two explores connections with foreign exchange and capital markets.  NOTE:  The first week of Part Two reviews Part One, so you can take Part Two even if you missed Part One.
Long desc:  This is Part Two of a two-part course; you can find Part One <a href="https://class.coursera.org/money-001/class" target="_blank">here</a>.  The description below pertains to the course as a whole, both parts.<br><br>The last three or four decades have seen a remarkable evolution in the institutions that comprise the modern monetary system. The financial crisis of 2007-2009 is a wakeup call that we need a similar evolution in the analytical apparatus and theories that we use to understand that system. Produced and sponsored by the Institute for New Economic Thinking, this course is an attempt to begin the process of new economic thinking by reviving and updating some forgotten traditions in monetary thought that have become newly relevant.<br><br>Three features of the new system are central.<br><br>Most important, the intertwining of previously separate capital markets and money markets has produced a system with new dynamics as well as new vulnerabilities. The financial crisis revealed those vulnerabilities for all to see. The result was two years of desperate innovation by central banking authorities as they tried first this, and then that, in an effort to stem the collapse.  <br><br>Second, the global character of the crisis has revealed the global character of the system, which is something new in postwar history but not at all new from a longer time perspective.  Central bank cooperation was key to stemming the collapse, and the details of that cooperation hint at the outlines of an emerging new international monetary order. <br><br>Third, absolutely central to the crisis was the operation of key derivative contracts, most importantly credit default swaps and foreign exchange swaps. Modern money cannot be understood separately from modern finance, nor can modern monetary theory be constructed separately from modern financial theory. That's the reason this course places dealers, in both capital markets and money markets, at the very center of the picture, as profit-seeking suppliers of market liquidity to the new system of market-based credit.

Title:  Introduction to Astronomy
Short desc:  An introduction to astronomy through a broad survey of what we know about the universe and how we know it.
Long desc:  In this class, we will be studying, quite literally, everything in the universe. &nbsp;We will start with "classical" astronomy, describing the night sky and organizing what we see as was done in ancient times. &nbsp;We will then embark on a journey,
starting here on Earth and progressing outward, to study the Solar system, the Milky Way galaxy, and the wonderful and strange objects we observe in deep space, such as black holes, quasars, and supernovae. &nbsp;We will end with some discussion of what
scientists know today about the universe as a whole. &nbsp;Along the way we will introduce some of the methods, theoretical and experimental, that have been used to understand all of this, from Newton's laws, through our understanding of light and matter,
to Einstein's theory of relativity, and from Galileo's telescope to WMAP.

Title:  An Introduction to Marketing
Short desc:  This Wharton course will teach the fundamentals of marketing by getting to the root of customer decision making. The course will focus on branding strategies, customer centricity and new market entry.
Long desc:  <p><b>PART OF THE WHARTON FOUNDATION SERIES</b> 
</p>
<p></p>
<p>This course is part of the Wharton foundation series in the MOOC format. It is taught by three of Wharton's top faculty in the marketing department, which is consistently ranked as the #1 marketing department in the world. This course features on-location
    videos and debates between the three professors.</p>
<p>The three core topics focus on customer loyalty. The first is about branding: given a very disparate world in which new startups are emerging constantly, brand equity is one of the key elements of keeping customers so that they have a trusted source for
    their needs. The second topic is customer centricity, which is taught in a global context where students learn how to gather needs and focus on the customer via discussion forums and empirical examples which are advanced by the mix of cultures in
    the course. Finally, the course explores practical, go-to-market strategies to help students understand the drivers that influence customers and see how these are implemented prior to making an investment.</p>

Title:  Asset Pricing
Short desc:  This course is an introductory survey of graduate-level academic asset pricing. We will focus on building the intuition and deep understanding of how the theory works, how to use it, and how to connect it to empirical facts.


Long desc:  <div>Are you curious about quantitative academic finance? Have you considered graduate study in finance? Are you working in an investment bank, money-management firm or hedge fund and you want to understand models better? Would you like to know what buzzwords like beta, risk premium, risk-neutral price, arbitrage, and discount factor mean? This class is for you. <br><br>We will see how one basic idea, price equals expected discounted payoff, unites everything - models that describe stocks, bonds, options, real investments, discrete time, continuous time, asset pricing, portfolio theory, and so forth. </div><div><br></div><div>We'll start with the underlying consumption-based model, and we’ll preview the classic issues in finance. We’ll think about asset pricing in a simple economic equilibrium. Then, we'll take a step back and study contingent claims and the theorems showing the existence of a discount factor (the m in p=E(mx)). We'll explore the mean-variance frontier and expected return vs. beta models and factor structures. A brief tour of current facts and puzzles follows. Then, off to study options and the Black-Scholes formula, bond pricing models and facts. We will close with modern portfolio theory. </div><div><br></div><div>The math in real finance is not actually that hard. Understanding how to use the equations, and see what they really mean about the world... that's hard, and that's what I hope will be uniquely rewarding about this class.</div>

Title:  Design: Creation of Artifacts in Society
Short desc:  Combine fundamental concepts with hands-on design challenges to become a better designer.

Long desc:  This is a course aimed at making you a better designer. The course marries theory and practice, as both are valuable in improving design performance. Lectures and readings will lay out the fundamental concepts that underpin design as a human activity.
Weekly design challenges test your ability to apply those ideas to solve real problems. The course is deliberately broad - spanning all domains of design, including architecture, graphics, services, apparel, engineered goods, and products. The emphasis
of the course is the basic design process: define, explore, select, and refine. You, the student, bring to the course your particular interests and expertise related to, for instance, engineering, furniture, fashion, architecture, or products. In prior
sessions of the course about half of the participants were novices and about half had prior professional design expertise. Both groups seem to benefit substantially from the course. All project work is evaluated by your peers -- and indeed, you will also
be a peer reviewer. This format allows you to see an interesting collection of projects while getting useful feedback on your own project.
<br>
<br><b>Student Testimonials from Earlier Sessions of the Course:</b>
<br>
<span>"An amazing course - a joy to take. I will really miss checking in every
    week to see the latest. I learned a great deal, from the videos, [the course staff] and my fellow
    students. I think getting the feedback from my peers was such a great way
    to run the course. So many ideas, suggestions, thoughts and words of encouragement
    that were so appreciated. I've been driving everyone I know talking about it all the time." &nbsp;--E. Wadsworth-Jones
<br>
<br>"When I signed up for this course I didn't know what to expect; the experience
was so good and rewarding. I just loved it every step of the way. The course
was brilliant, challenging and fun! Our professor, Prof. Karl Ulrich, is
an amazing teacher, I loved his down to Earth approach.  Participating in a tournament was also one of the course's highlights. The whole thing was a great, unforgettable experience. I wish to thank with all my heart Coursera and the University of Pennsylvania for the opportunity given
to us."

Title:  Designing Cities
Short desc:  The course explores visionary and practical concepts of city design and planning, past and present, and  how design can address such looming challenges as urban population growth, climate change and rising sea levels.  Participants will be encouraged to make proposals for city design and development, starting with their own immediate environment.  
Long desc:  <p><span>Designing Cities is a ten-week
course starting in October 2013.  Every
week will focus on a different aspect of Designing Cities including: How
Today’s City Evolved; The Ideas That Shape Cities; Tools for Designing Cities;
Making Cities Sustainable; Cities in the Information Age; Preserving Older
Cities; Designing New Cities, Districts and Neighborhoods; The Challenges of
Informal Cities and Disadvantaged Neighborhoods; and Visionary Cities.<b>  </b>Materials will be presented by the
instructors and guest faculty from PennDesign through a series of five or more modules per week, each typically 10-12
minutes long.   </span></p>

<p>The first module each week will be a roundtable discussion among
professors Stefan Al, Jonathan Barnett, and Gary Hack introducing the big issues
associated with the subject.  Each
succeeding module will be a self-contained illustrated presentation of a set of
ideas and images. There will be a list of suggested readings for those who wish
to follow up on the ideas in each module.</p>

<p>Everyone enrolled in Designing Cities will be expected to
complete 3 assignments.  These
will be posted on the course site and they will be in the form of peer assessments. There will also be three sessions where we discuss a selection of
the assignments that have been submitted. There will be a great deal to be
learned from the ideas participants submit, reflecting cities of all sizes and
circumstances across the globe.</p>

The course concludes with a
discussion by the faculty of the issues raised in the discussion groups and
responses to the assignments. We are looking forward to connecting with you and
seeing the issues at the forefront in designing your city.

Title:  Global Warming: The Science of Climate Change
Short desc:  This class describes the science of global warming and the forecast for humans’ impact on Earth’s climate. Intended for an audience without much scientific background but a healthy sense of curiosity, the class brings together insights and perspectives from physics, chemistry, biology, earth and atmospheric sciences, and even some economics—all based on a foundation of simple mathematics (algebra). 
Long desc:  <p>We start with basic principles governing
Earth’s temperature. The class begins
with the nature of heat and light, then builds the very simplest conceptual—and
algebraic—model for the climate of a planet, including the greenhouse effect.</p><p>Over the following weeks, we introduce
complexities of the real world to this model: how greenhouse gases are
selective about what light they absorb, how the temperature structure and weather
in the atmosphere set the stage for the greenhouse effect, and how
feedbacks amplify it. From this
point on the exercises will be based on
on-line interactive models for various aspects of Earth’s
climate and carbon cycle, exploring the topics
described in the video lectures.&nbsp;</p><p>We then turn to the carbon cycle of
the Earth,&nbsp;how it stabilizes Earth’s climate on some time scales but
destabilizes it on others. The fate of fossil fuel carbon will
be determined by its integration into Earth’s ongoing natural
carbon cycle.</p><p>






























</p><p>The class concludes with a look
at the human impact on Earth’s climate: why we believe it’s
changing, why we believe we’re changing it, the impacts that could have, and
the options we have to mitigate the situation.</p>

Course ID:  971106
Title:  Inspiring Leadership through Emotional Intelligence
Short desc:  Emotional intelligence, hope, mindfulness, and compassion help a person reverse the damage of chronic stress and build great leadership relationships. The Positive and Negative Emotional Attractors inspire sustained, desired change and learning at many levels. 
Long desc:  <p>Great leaders move us through our emotions. They establish a deep emotional
    connection with others called resonance. Their own levels of emotional
    intelligence allow them to create and nurture these resonant relationships.
    They use their EI as a path to resonant leadership through mindfulness,
    hope, compassion, and playfulness. Unfortunately, most people in leadership
    and helping positions (i.e., doctors, teachers, coaches, etc.) lose their
    effectiveness over time because of the cumulative damage from chronic stress.
    But humans can renew themselves, neurologically, hormonally, and emotionally.</p>
<p>Based on decades of&nbsp;research into emotional intelligence&nbsp;competencies
    and longitudinal studies of their development, the course will examine
    resonance and developing "resonant leadership" capability,&nbsp;emotional
    intelligence, and the experiences of mindfulness, hope, and compassion.
    Using the latest in neuroscience, behavioral, organizational and psychological
    research, participants will&nbsp;understand the theory, research, and experience
    of the Positive Emotional Attractor that is an essential beginning to sustained,
    desired change for individuals, teams, organizations and communities.&nbsp;</p><p>The course will consist of nine classes, with three or so
modules per class, to be taken over 8 weeks. Each module will consist of a
video, assigned and recommended readings, reflective exercises, writing in your
Personal Journal, and on-line, asynchronous discussions. Each class will have personal
learning assignments to use and tests of comprehension.&nbsp;</p>

Title:  Grow to Greatness: Smart Growth for Private Businesses, Part II
Short desc:  This course focuses on the common human resource ("people") challenges faced by existing private businesses when they attempt to grow substantially. PART 1 OF THE GROW TO GREATNESS COURSE IS NOT A PREREQUISITE FOR TAKING THIS COURSE.
Long desc:  <div>Most entrepreneurship courses focus on how to start a business. Few focus
    on the next big entrepreneurial inflection point: how do you successfully
    grow an existing private business? This is the focus of this Course. It
    is based on the instructor's research and thirty years of real-world experience
    advising private growth companies.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>This Course will focus on the common “people” challenges private growth
    companies face as they grow. You will study stories of how six different
    private businesses faced their growth challenges.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>While strategic focus and operational excellence are necessary to build
    a great growth company, they are not sufficient. Growth requires the right
    kind of leadership, culture, and people. My research clearly showed that
    many entrepreneurs struggle with personal challenges presented to them
    by growth, as well as the challenge of hiring the right people and building
    the right management team that can play well together. The research shows
    that every growth business faces common challenges. You can learn from
    others' experience—you do not have to "reinvent the wheel".</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>The Course format is story based. Each case tells a compelling story.
    You will learn from Barbara Lynch, Ryan Dienst, Steve Ritter, Randy Bufford,
    John Gabbert, and Mike Cote. In addition, each week, we will discuss a
    different content theme. In Week 3, you will engage in a Workshop where
    you will be asked to apply the Growth System Assessment Tool. You will
    have the opportunity to create a Course Community of fellow students to
    learn from each other as the Course progresses.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>You will learn how entrepreneurs must grow, too; the “secret” of high
    performance; people-centric leadership; how to create high employee engagement;
    how to create an internal Growth System; and how to build a senior management
    team.</div>

Title:  Introduction to Psychology as a Science
Short desc:  Learn about how psychology has developed a body of knowledge about behavior and mind through the use of scientific methods. All areas of psychology will be covered.
Long desc:  Since we were young children, we have tried to understand, to predict,
and to control behavior. We first dealt with our parents and teachers,
and later our friends and companions. This course shows, however,
how the understanding, prediction, and control of behavior require scientific
validation. By using tools that are systematic and objective, psychology
has learned how people behave and think.
<br>
<br>Psychology is a very broad field of study and the course will include
discussions of the brain and nervous system, sensation and perception,
learning, memory, intelligence and thinking, lifespan development, emotion
and motivation, personality, social behavior, behavioral disorders, and
psychological treatment of disorders. The course will include short
lecture modules, demonstrations and experiments, and writing assignments.

Title:  Major Depression in the Population: A Public Health Approach
Short desc:  Illustrates the principles of public health applied to depressive disorder, including principles of epidemiology, transcultural psychiatry, health services research, and prevention.
Long desc:  <p>Public
Mental Health is the application of the principles of medicine and social
science to prevent the occurrence of mental and behavioral disorders and to
promote mental health of the population. This course illustrates the principles of public health applied to
depressive disorder, including principles of epidemiology, transcultural
psychiatry, health services research, and prevention. It is predicted that by 2020 depressive disorder will be the
most important cause of disease burden in the entire world!  Every human being suffers from feeling
depressed at some point or other, but only about one fifth of the population
will experience an episode of depressive disorder over the course of their
lives. This course
illuminates the public health approach to disease, and the particular
complexities of applying this approach to mental disorders, using depression as
the exemplar.  </p>

Title:  Introduction to Logic
Short desc:  In this course, you will learn how to formalize information and reason systematically to produce logical conclusions. We will also examine logic technology and its applications - in mathematics, science, engineering, business, law, and so forth.
Long desc:  <p>Logic is one of the oldest intellectual disciplines in human history.
    It dates back to the times of Aristotle; it has been studied through the
    centuries; and it is still a subject of active investigation today.</p>
<p>This course is a basic introduction to Logic. It shows how to formalize
    information in form of logical sentences. It shows how to reason systematically
    with this information to produce all logical conclusions and only logical
    conclusions. And it examines logic technology and its applications - in
    mathematics, science, engineering, business, law, and so forth.</p>
<p>The course differs from other introductory courses in Logic in two important
    ways. First of all, it teaches a novel theory of logic that improves accessibility
    while preserving rigor. Second, the material is laced with interactive
    demonstrations and exercises that suggest the many practical applications
    of the field.</p>

Title:  Reason and Persuasion: Thinking Through Three Dialogues By Plato
Short desc:  In this course we will study Plato's ancient art of blowing up your beliefs as you go, to make sure they're built to last. We spend six weeks studying three Platonic dialogues, then two more weeks pondering a pair of footnotes to Plato; that is, we will consider some contemporary manifestations of issues Plato discusses. The more things change, the more they stay the same.
Long desc:  <p><i>"The safest general characterization of the European
philosophical tradition is that it consists of a series of footnotes to Plato.”</i></p>

<p>– A. N. Whitehead</p>

<p>Elsewhere
Whitehead points out how Plato pulled it off: by writing all the ‘heresies’ in
advance. That is, whenever anyone says Plato was wrong—and how, and why—it
turns out Plato himself said it first. (As P.T. Barnum said—but maybe Plato
proved it first?—there’s no such thing as bad publicity. And the cover-up is
usually worse than the crime. That's as true in philosophy as in US politics)</p>

<p>In
this course, students study Plato’s ancient art of blowing up your beliefs as
you go, to make sure they’re built to last. We spend six weeks reading three
Platonic dialogues (a bit like plays, in which we see two sides of an argument
come to life.) Then, for two more weeks, we study a pair of footnotes. That is,
we will consider some contemporary manifestations of issues Plato discusses.
Our focus will be: moral theory and moral psychology.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It
turns out: the more you blow up your beliefs, the more they stay the same (as I
mentioned already).</p>

<p>Why
‘Reason and Persuasion’? The title is generic, and indicates that the course
will be - if this is what you are looking for - a general, introduction to
philosophy, as it tends to be taught at the university level. But the title
also points to a specific problem: reason without persuasion is useless;
persuasion without reason is dangerous. Plato worried about it. So will we.</p>

<p>The
course will be of interest to a wide variety of students. There are a variety
of reasons why you might want to know at least a little about what Plato
thought and wrote. I will do my best to teach in a way that accommodates as
wide a range of likely interests in the subject as i can manage.</p>

Title:  Nutrition and Physical Activity for Health
Short desc:  This course will provide a coherent, understandable look at the evidence on how nutrition and physical activity impact health through lower morbidity, longevity, and quality of life.
Long desc:  Over 65 percent of adults and over 30 percent of children meet the classification
of being overweight or obese, and with this excess weight comes numerous
health conditions that include heart disease, diabetes, cancer, musculoskeletal
disorders, and even impairments in cognitive function. Because in most
cases the core cause of obesity and its related health conditions is a
poor quality of diet and lack of sufficient physical activity, it is no
surprise that to reverse this health problem a foundation of proper nutrition
and sufficient physical activity is imperative.
<br>
<br>This course is designed to provide a foundation of nutritional knowledge
to develop a sustainable pattern of healthy eating. To this will be added
a foundation of knowledge related to physical activity and exercise. These
two key lifestyle behaviors are then brought together under the umbrella
of calorie balance, which is the understanding of how we balance the calories
that we eat in our diet with the calories that we burn to sustain life
and to perform all of our daily tasks and functions.
<br>
<br>Ultimately, this information can only be of value if individuals understand
how to engage in these healthy behaviors within their daily lives when
they are faced with challenges and barriers. This course will address key
issues and will provide information on effective strategies for adopting
and maintaining these targeted behaviors as they apply to the adoption
and maintenance of a healthy lifestyle.

Title:  High Performance Scientific Computing
Short desc:  Programming-oriented course on effectively using modern computers to solve scientific computing problems arising in the physical/engineering sciences and other fields. Provides an introduction to efficient serial and parallel computing using Fortran 90, OpenMP, MPI, and Python, and software development tools such as version control, Makefiles, and debugging.
Long desc:  <p>Computation and simulation are increasingly important in all aspects of
    science and engineering. At the same time writing efficient computer programs
    to take full advantage of current computers is becoming increasingly difficult.
    Even laptops now have 4 or more processors, but using them all to solve
    a single problem faster often requires rethinking the algorithm to introduce
    parallelism, and then programming in a language that can express this parallelism.&nbsp;
    Writing efficient programs also requires some knowledge of machine arithmetic,
    computer architecture, and memory hierarchies.</p>
<p>Although parallel computing will be covered, this is <i>not</i> a class
    on the most advanced techniques for using supercomputers, which these days
    have tens of thousands of processors and cost millions of dollars. Instead,
    the goal is to teach tools that you can use immediately on your own laptop,
    desktop, or a small cluster. Cloud computing will also be discussed, and
    students who don't have a multiprocessor computer of their own will still
    be able to do projects using Amazon Web Services at very low cost.</p>
<p>Along the way there will also be discussion of software engineering tools
    such as debuggers, unit testing, Makefiles, and the use of version control
    systems. After all, your time is more valuable than computer time, and
    a program that runs fast is totally useless if it produces the wrong results.</p>
<p>High performance <i>programming</i> is also an important aspect of high
    performance scientific computing, and so another main theme of the course
    is the use of basic tools and techniques to improve your efficiency as
    a computational scientist.</p>

Title:  Introduction à la théorie de Galois
Short desc:  Le cours expose la théorie de Galois, du classique critère de non-résolubilité des équations polynomiales aux méthodes plus avancées de calcul de groupes de Galois par réduction modulo un nombre premier.
Long desc:  Le thème général
de cette théorie est l'étude des racines d'un polynôme et concerne en
particulier la possibilité de les exprimer à partir des coefficients de ce
polynôme. Evariste Galois considère les symétries de ces racines et associe
ainsi à ce polynôme un groupe de permutations de ses racines, que l'on appelle
maintenant son groupe de Galois. Il dégage à cette occasion pour la première
fois, dans ce cadre, la notion de groupe, maintenant omniprésente en
mathématiques. Son étude lui permet d'expliquer pourquoi les racines d'une
équation prise au hasard ne s'expriment en général pas par des formules
algébriques faisant intervenir ses coefficients à partir du degré 5, un
résultat démontré auparavant par Abel. Plus généralement, l'étude du groupe de
Galois du polynôme permet de dire exactement quand une telle formule existe.
C'est ce que l'on appelle la correspondance de Galois : elle relie d'une part
la théorie des corps, d'autre part la théorie des groupes.<br><br>

<p>Ce cours
expliquera cette théorie en n'utilisant que des résultats de base d'algèbre
linéaire. Nous étudierons d'un côté la théorie des corps, c'est-à-dire la façon
dont les corps s'emboîtent les uns dans les autres, en introduisant la notion
de nombre algébrique (essentiellement les racines de polynômes). D'un autre
côté, nous introduirons les éléments nécessaires à l'étude des groupes de
permutations. Cela nous permettra d'expliquer la théorie de Galois, non
seulement dans son cadre d'origine, c'est-à-dire quand les coefficients du
polynôme sont des nombres entiers, mais aussi dans un cadre plus général, par
exemple lorsqu'on réduit ces coefficients modulo un nombre premier p.</p>



<p>Le cours
culminera avec une comparaison des groupes de Galois dans ces deux situations
(« entière » et après réduction modulo p), fournissant ainsi un outil de calcul
puissant de ces groupes.</p>



<p>Ce cours est
l'occasion d'aborder des notions d'algèbre variées, essentielles dans de
nombreux domaines des mathématiques, de manière très simple pour très rapidement
aboutir à des résultats tout à fait remarquables.
Nous n'avons pas cherché la généralité maximale mais au contraire à aller rapidement à l'essentiel en utilisant le
minimum de formalisme abstrait. Le MOOCueur intéressé sera alors armé pour
aller plus loin, notamment grâce à la bibliographie ou à des cours plus
avancés.<span><br>

Title:  Statistical Analysis of fMRI Data
Short desc:  Explore the intersection of statistics and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), a non-invasive technique for studying brain activity. 
Long desc:  In this course we will explore the intersection of statistics and&nbsp;functional magnetic resonance imaging, or fMRI, which is a&nbsp;non-invasive technique for studying brain activity. We will discuss&nbsp;the analysis of fMRI data, from its acquisition to its use in locating&nbsp;brain activity, making inference about brain connectivity and&nbsp;predictions about psychological or disease states. A standard fMRI&nbsp;study gives rise to massive amounts of noisy data with a complicated&nbsp;spatio-temporal correlation structure. Statistics plays a crucial role&nbsp;in understanding the nature of the data and obtaining relevant results&nbsp;that can be used and interpreted by neuroscientists.

Title:  Introductory Physics I with Laboratory
Short desc:  Explore motion in the real world using modern tools and techniques (video capture and analysis, computer modeling) guided by fundamental physics principles.
Long desc:  <div>
    <p>We will investigate motion in the world around us; we welcome both those
        who want to participate fully and those who wish to sample, cafeteria-style,
        the activities of this course. &nbsp;Those who participate fully will experience
        a course that is very different in style but equivalent (at least) in core
        content to a traditional, on-campus, first-semester college-level introductory
        physics course that includes a laboratory. At the same time, those who
        cherry-pick selected course elements (e.g., learning the basics of video
        capture and analysis of motion in one’s own surroundings) will still advance
        their understanding of physics. &nbsp;&nbsp;
        <br>
    </p>
    <p>We aim to understand and to predict motion in the real world using a small
        set of powerful fundamental principles. The laboratories are the backbone
        of this course, providing opportunities (1) to observe and to analyze motion
        in our own surroundings, (2) to apply fundamental principles to build explanations
        of the motion, and (3) to evaluate, in a constructively critical way, our
        own measurements and models, as well as the measurements and models of
        our course peers. Other course elements (lecture videos with “clicker”
        questions, homework) support and extend the physics explored in the laboratories.</p>Participants
    who satisfactorily complete the course will be eligible for six (6) Continuing
    Education Units from the American Association of Physics Teachers.&nbsp;</div>

Title:  Health Informatics in the Cloud
Short desc:  A non-technical introduction to the contemporary application of computing to healthcare delivery, public health and community-based clinical research.
Long desc:  <div>This course is intended to help even non-technically trained students gain basic proficiency in health informatics: the application of computing to healthcare delivery, public health and community-based clinical research. This is distinct from the related field of bioinformatics, which explores the role of computing in understanding the genomic and proteomic processes within cells. Weeks 1-2 cover the US healthcare delivery system's unique structural, economic and policy issues and how they create a potentially strategic role for health informatics. Week 3-5 explain at a high level the core technologies involved in contemporary health informatics. Weeks 6-8 explore how these technologies are being deployed using some of the best commercial and open source products as examples. Weeks 9-10 present the technologies that have been developed to explore the digital data provided by these new systems with several examples of cutting edge research using "big data". As the course progresses, students can, optionally, also read the appropriate draft chapters of the instructor’s forthcoming text, An Introduction to Contemporary Health Informatics. </div>

Title:  Games without Chance: Combinatorial Game Theory 
Short desc:  This course will cover the mathematical theory and analysis of simple games without chance moves.
Long desc:   This course explores the
mathematical theory of two player games without chance moves. We will cover
simplifying games, determining when games are equivalent to numbers, and
impartial games. Many of the examples will be with simple games that may be new
to you: Hackenbush, Nim, Push, Toads and Frogs, and others. While this probably
won’t make you a better chess or go player, the course will give you a better
insight into the structure of games.

Title:  Statistical Reasoning for Public Health: Estimation, Inference, & Interpretation
Short desc:  A conceptual and interpretive public health approach to some of the most commonly used methods from basic statistics. 
Long desc:  <p>In this data centric era, statistics has become an
essential tool for processing information from the realm of public health and
medical research.  Understanding
both the implications and limitations of the results from such research is essential for making informed treatment decisions, public health practice
protocols and policy recommendations. 
In this class, a conceptual and interpretive approach is applied to some
of the most used methods from basic statistics.  The course will detail appropriate summary measures for
quantifying the health of single populations, and comparing such outcomes
between populations using results from representative but imperfect data
samples.  Additionally, the role of
uncertainty in sample based estimated will be covered, allowing for conclusions
to be drawn regarding the larger populations under study while recognizing the
imperfection in the study estimates. 
All topics will be considered through a “conceptual lens” allowing
students to focus on the “what”, “why”, and “so what” with regards to the
implications of research results.</p>

Title:  Design and Interpretation of Clinical Trials
Short desc:  Learn the basic principles for design of randomized clinical trials and how they should be reported. 
Long desc:  <p>Clinical trials are experiments designed to evaluate new
interventions to prevent or treat disease in humans.  The interventions evaluated can be drugs, devices (e.g.,
hearing aid), surgeries, behavioral interventions (e.g., smoking cessation
program), community health programs (e.g. cancer screening programs) or health
delivery systems (e.g., special care units for hospital admissions).  We consider clinical trials experiments
because the investigators rather the patients or their doctors select the
treatment the patients receive.  Results
from randomized clinical trials are usually considered the highest level of
evidence for determining whether a treatment is effective because trials
incorporates features to ensure that evaluation of the benefits and risks of
treatments are objective and unbiased.  The FDA requires that drugs or biologics (e.g., vaccines) are
shown to be effective in clinical trials before they can be sold in the US.</p>

<p>The course will explain the basic principles for design of
randomized clinical trials and how they should be reported.  In the first part of the course, students
will be introduced to terminology used in clinical trials and the several
common designs used for clinical trials, such as parallel and cross-over
designs.  We will also explain some
of the mechanics of clinical trials, like randomization and blinding of
treatment.  In the second half of
the course, we will explain how clinical trials are analyzed and
interpreted.  Finally, we will
review the essential ethical consideration involved in conducting experiments
on people.</p>

Title:  Jazz Improvisation
Short desc:  Learn the basic concepts of improvisation from Gary Burton, one of the most renowned improvisers in the jazz world, including the mental, melodic, and harmonic processes that contribute to the instinctive skills that an improviser puts to use when taking a solo.
Long desc:  While many people are fans of
jazz and understand that musicians are often “making up” the
notes they are playing during a performance, most people—often
including musicians, themselves, who are beginning to learn improvising—aren’t
clear about what exact processes take place to enable this to happen. The
purpose of this course is to introduce the basic concepts of modern improvisation and
how to go about mastering the different musical and mental skills involved. <br><br>Course author Gary Burton codifies a sought-after approach to improvisation that has been at the 
core of Berklee College of Music's curriculum for decades. Students who complete
this course will know what to practice and how to practice the
various aspects of improvising, in addition to understanding how the improviser spontaneously
communicates to the listeners through their musical creations.

Primary emphasis on the nature and functions of product markets, the theory of the firm under varying conditions of competition and monopoly, and the role of government in promoting efficiency in the economy.
Long desc:  <h2>Why 3 Versions?</h2>

<p><b>Note</b>: In January 2014 we will offer 3 versions of this course so
    that you can choose a version that best meets your needs. Two of the versions
    are identical except for the duration of the course. The third version

    aspects of microeconomics principles. See further below for more details
    about the differences.</p>

<h2>About the Course</h2>

<p>Most people make the incorrect assumption that economics is ONLY the study
    of money.  My primary goal in this course is to shatter this belief.
     In fact, in the last 50 years economists have tackled some of the
    most interesting and important questions for humanity.  For instance,
    the following are just a few examples:</p>

Title:  Microeconomics Principles
Short desc:  Introduction to the functions of individual decision-makers, both consumers and producers, within the larger economic system. Primary emphasis on the nature and functions of product markets, the theory of the firm under varying conditions of competition and monopoly, and the role of government in promoting efficiency in the economy.
Long desc:  <h2>Why 3 Versions?</h2>

<p><b>Note</b>: In January 2014 we will offer 3 versions of this course so
    that you can choose a version that best meets your needs. Two of the versions
    are identical except for the duration of the course. The third version
    is both shorter and covers slightly less material, focusing on just the most critical
    aspects of microeconomics principles. See further below for more details
    about the differences.</p>

<p>Most people make the incorrect assumption that economics is ONLY the study

Title:  Financial Engineering and Risk Management Part I
Short desc:  This course provides an introduction to various classes of derivative securities and we will learn how to price them using "risk-neutral pricing". In the follow-up to this course (FE & RM Part II) we will consider portfolio optimization, risk management and more advanced examples of derivatives pricing including, for example, real options and energy derivatives. 
Long desc:  Financial Engineering is a multidisciplinary field involving finance and economics, mathematics, statistics, engineering and computational methods.  The emphasis of <b>FE & RM</b> <b>Part I</b> will be on the use of simple stochastic models to price derivative securities in various asset classes including equities, fixed income, credit and mortgage-backed securities. We will also consider the role that some of these asset classes played during the financial crisis. A notable feature of this course will be an interview module with <b>Emanuel Derman</b>, the renowned ``quant'' and best-selling author of "My Life as a Quant".  <br><br>We hope that students who complete the course and the follow-up course (<b>FE & RM</b> <b>Part II</b>) will have a good understanding of the "rocket science" behind financial engineering. But perhaps more importantly, we hope they will also understand the limitations of this theory in practice and why financial models should always be treated with a healthy degree of skepticism.

Title:  Discrete Inference and Learning in Artificial Vision
Short desc:  We will present the state of the art energy minimization algorithms that are used to perform inference in modern artificial vision models: that is, efficient methods for obtaining the most likely interpretation of a given visual input. We will also cover the popular max-margin framework for estimating the model parameters using inference.
Long desc:  <p>Artificial
vision applications, such as object detection in natural images and automatic
segmentation of medical acquisitions, rely on models that interpret the visual
information provided to a computer. The model provides a compromise between the
support given by the observations and the prior domain knowledge. This course
is concerned with the two computational problems that arise when using such models
in practice.</p>

<p><i>Inference
(Energy Minimization):</i></p>

<p>Given a visual observation (for example, an image or an MRI scan), we
are interested in estimating its most likely interpretation (i.e. the location of all
the objects in the image, or the segments of the MRI scan) according to the
model. While the problem cannot be solved optimally, we will describe state of the art approximate algorithms that provide very accurate solutions in
practice. While the theoretical properties of the algorithms will be discussed
briefly, the main emphasis will be on their application.</p>

<p><i> Learning
(Parameter Estimation):</i><br></p>

<p>Given a set of training samples consisting of inputs and their desired
outputs, (for example, images and the location of the objects, or MRI scans and
their segmentations) we would like to estimate a model that is suited to the
task at hand. We will show how the problem of learning a model can be
formulated as empirical risk minimization. Furthermore, we will present
efficient algorithms for solving the corresponding optimization problem.</p>

Title:  An Introduction to Functional Analysis
Short desc:  Learn about functional analysis
Long desc:  Functional analysis is the branch of mathematics dealing with spaces of
functions. It is a valuable tool in theoretical mathematics as well as
engineering. It is at the very core of numerical simulation.
<br>
<br>In this class, I will explain the concepts of convergence and talk about
topology. You will understand the difference between strong convergence
and weak convergence. You will also see how these two concepts can be used.
<br>
<br>You will learn about different types of spaces including metric spaces,
Banach Spaces, Hilbert Spaces and what property can be expected. You will
see beautiful lemmas and theorems such as Riesz and Lax-Milgram and I will
also describe Lp spaces, Sobolev spaces and provide a few details about
PDEs, or Partial Differential Equations.

Title:  Beginning Game Programming with C#
Short desc:  Start learning how to program video games using the C# programming language. Plenty of practice opportunities are included!
Long desc:  <p>The Beginning Game
Programming with C# course is all about learning how to develop video games
using the C# programming language. Why use C# instead of C++, Java,
ActionScript, or some other programming language you may have heard of? First,
using C# lets us use the Microsoft XNA and open-source MonoGame frameworks,
which help us quickly develop games for Windows, Android, iOS, Mac OS, and
others. Second, the Unity game engine is very popular with indie game
developers, and C# is one of the programming languages you can use in the Unity
environment. And finally, C# is a really good language for learning how to
program.</p>



<p>That learning how to program
comment is important because this course doesn't assume you have any previous programming
experience. Don't worry if you've never written code before; we'll start at the
very beginning and work our way up to building a small, complete game by the
end of the course. Throughout the course you'll learn core programming concepts
that apply to lots of programming languages, including C#, and you'll also
learn how to apply those concepts when you develop games: drawing all the
entities in the game world, updating the game world based on user input and
simple physics, playing music and sound effects in your games, and so on.</p>



Computer programming is really fun in general,
and programming games is even better!<br><br>

Title:  Introduction to Recommender Systems
Short desc:  This course introduces the concepts, applications, algorithms, programming, and design of recommender systems--software systems that recommend products or information, often based on extensive personalization.  Learn how web merchants such as Amazon.com personalize product suggestions and how to apply the same techniques in your own systems!
Long desc:  <p>Recommender
 systems have changed the way people find products, information, and even 
other people. They study patterns of behavior to know what someone will 
prefer from among a collection of things he has never experienced. The 
technology behind recommender systems has evolved over the past 20 years
 into a rich collection of tools that enable the practitioner or 
researcher to develop effective recommenders. We will study the most 
important of those tools, including how they work, how to use them, how 
to evaluate them, and their strengths and weaknesses in practice.</p><p>The
 algorithms we will study include content-based filtering, user-user 
collaborative filtering, item-item collaborative filtering, dimensionality 
reduction, and interactive critique-based recommenders. The approach 
will be hands-on, with six two week projects, each of which will involve
 implementation and evaluation of some type of recommender.</p><p>In addition to topical lectures, this course includes interviews and 
guest lectures with experts from both academia and industry.<br></p><p><b>Two Ways to Take this Course</b>:</p><p>This course is designed to support two different types of students and educational goals:</p><p><i>Programming Track</i>:  Designed
 for students with significant programming and mathematics experience 
(see below), the programming track combines a conceptual and 
mathematical understanding of recommender systems with experience 
programming six different recommender systems projects.  Students 
completing this travel will gain the skills needed to implement basic 
recommenders from scratch, and to use software libraries and tools to 
implement more advanced recommenders.</p><p><i>Concepts Track</i>:<span>
  Students who are not experienced programmers, or who are primarily 
interested in understanding the concepts and techniques of recommender 
systems, without learning to program them, can choose to focus on the 
conceptual and mathematical content, skipping the programming projects 
and associated lecture content.  Students in the concepts track are 
still expected to have significant familiarity with computing systems 
and college-level mathematics, but need not be accomplished programmers.
  We expect this track to be useful for tech-savvy marketing and 
business leaders, as well as engineering managers who may oversee but 
not directly develop recommender systems.  We also hope it will be 
useful to those looking to understand recommender systems concepts 
without the workload associated with programming those systems.  <br></span></p>

Title:  Comic Books and Graphic Novels
Short desc:  Comic books have arrived! "Comic Books and Graphic Novels" presents a survey of the comic book canon and of the major graphic novels in circulation today. Its governing question is simple: by what terms can we discuss comic books as literary art? In pursuit of that question it develops a theory of literary reading and time itself.

Visit us at www.facebook.com/UCBComics
Reddit Username: Kuskin (staff cpav13)
Long desc:  The comic book pamphlet developed as an independent literary form in the 1930s and early 1940s and has been a favorite of adolescent enthusiasts and cult devotees ever since. Recently, it has entered into a process of transformation, moving from a species
of pulp fiction on the margins of children’s literature to an autonomous genre, one Will Eisner labeled the graphic novel. This transformation has been noted in such literary venues as the New York Times and the New Yorker, as well as in an increasing
number of university classrooms and bookstore shelves.
<br>
<br>“Comic Books and Graphic Novels” presents a survey of the history of American comics and a review of major graphic novels circulating in the U. S. today. It is focused on three main points. First, it argues that as comics develop in concert with, and
participate in literary culture, they should be considered literature. Second, it reasons that such a designation forces us to redefine our concept of literature itself. Finally, it explores this transformative literary world by arguing that comics have
much to teach us about ourselves.

Title:  A Brief History of Humankind
Short desc:  The course surveys the entire length of human history, from the evolution of various human species in the Stone Age up to the political and technological revolutions of the twenty-first century.
Long desc:  <p>About 2 million years ago our human
ancestors were&nbsp;insignificant animals living in a corner of Africa. Their impact on the world was no greater than
that of gorillas, zebras, or chickens. Today humans are spread all over the
world, and they are the most important animal around. The very future of life
on Earth depends on the ideas and behavior of our species. </p><p>This course will explain how we humans have conquered planet Earth, and how
we have changed our environment, our societies, and our own bodies and minds.
The aim of the course is to give students a brief but complete overview of
history, and to answer some basic historical questions such as:</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What is
religion?</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What is an
empire? </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What is
money?</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;What is
science?</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; What is
capitalism? &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Why did almost
all societies believe that women are inferior to men?</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Does
history have a direction?&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Did people
become happier as history progressed? </p><p>

the likely future of humankind?&nbsp;</p>

Title:  Making Better Group Decisions: Voting, Judgement Aggregation and Fair Division
Short desc:  Learn about different voting methods and fair division algorithms, and explore the problems that arise when a group of people need to make a decision.  
Long desc:  <div>
			<div>
				<div>
					<p>Much of our daily life is spent taking part in various types of what we might call “political”
procedures. Examples range from voting in a national election to deliberating with others
in small committees. Many interesting philosophical and mathematical issues arise when
we carefully examine our group decision-making processes.&nbsp;</p><p>There are two types of group
decision making problems that we will discuss in this course. A <i>voting problem</i>: Suppose
that a group of friends are deciding where to go for dinner. If everyone agrees on which
restaurant is best, then it is obvious where to go. But, how should the friends decide where
to go if they have different opinions about which restaurant is best? Can we always find a
choice that is “fair” taking into account everyone’s opinions or must we choose one person
from the group to act as a “dictator”? A <i>fair division problem</i>: Suppose that there is a cake and
a group of hungry children. Naturally, you want to cut the cake and distribute the pieces
to the children as fairly as possible. If the cake is homogeneous (e.g., a chocolate cake with
vanilla icing evenly distributed), then it is easy to find a fair division: give each child a piece
that is the same size. But, how do we find a “fair” division of the cake if it is heterogeneous
(e.g., icing that is 1/3 chocolate, 1/3 vanilla and 1/3 strawberry) and the children each want
different parts of the cake?&nbsp;</p>

Title:  21st Century American Foreign Policy
Short desc:  What is American foreign policy? Who makes it? Why is it the way it is? How does it affect the rest of the world? Professor Bruce Jentleson has taught the subject for over 30 years, written one of the leading books on it, and has served in numerous U.S. foreign policy positions.
Long desc:  <p>U.S. foreign policy has a huge impact on the world. That impact is widely debated among Americans and by people in many countries. Our goal in this course is to gain more understanding of what U.S. foreign policy is, who makes it, why is it the way it
    is, and how it affects the rest of the world. Through lectures, readings, and other course elements we build on the information available from the media and other such sources while delving deeper into the issues, their history, their broader context
    and major debates. We seek to do so as a community of learning committed not only to the curricular objectives for our course, but seeking to demonstrate to the world how to conduct informed and respectful discourse on subjects which have plenty of
    room for disagreement.</p>The first week of the course provides an overview and analytic framework, and focuses in on the process and politics by which U.S. foreign policy is made. Each of the next five weeks is geared to U.S. foreign policy in different
regions: Asia with a particular focus on U.S.-China relations; the Middle East and such issues as Iran, Arab-Israeli peace, Syria, and the Arab uprisings; relations with Western Europe and Russia; relations in the Western Hemisphere with Latin America
and Canada; and key issues in U.S.-Africa relations. While we cannot cover all issues, we do try for a balance of breadth and depth.

Title:  Programming Mobile Applications for Android Handheld Systems
Short desc:  Introduction to the design and implementation of applications for handheld systems, such as smartphones and tablets, running the Android Platform.
Long desc:  <p>Handheld systems, such as smartphones and tablets are now the most common way for people to access and interact with computing services. The demand for application development skills is therefore growing at a breathtaking pace. These skills, however,
    are multi-­‐ faceted, requiring students to master computer science and engineering principles, to learn the details of specific mobile application platforms, and to design artistic and engaging user interfaces that respond to how, where and why handheld
    applications are used.
</p>
<p>This course will cover the fundamental programming principles, software architecture and user experience considerations underlying handheld software applications and their development environments. To bring these concepts alive, the course will involve
    in-­‐depth, hands-­‐on examples, implemented in the Android Platform, the fastest growing segment of the handheld system user base. Students will apply these teachings, also using the Android Platform, in laboratory projects and in a large-­‐scale
    semester project. </p>
<p><b>Note: This course is part of a trans-institution course sequence</b>. </p>

<p>This course and two others, led respectively by Drs. Douglas Schmidt and Jules White of Vanderbilt University, have been designed to complement each other. Therefore, some of the programming assignments and the course project for these courses will be coordinated. 

</p><p> This course focuses on handheld systems and the design of user-facing applications, and will be taught first. The first Vanderbilt University course, <a href="https://www.coursera.org/course/posa" title="Link: https://www.coursera.org/course/posa">Pattern-Oriented Software Architectures: Programming Mobile Services for Android Handheld Systems</a> will
    focus on systems programming topics, such as middleware services and background processing, That course is currently schedule to start in March 2014.  The second Vanderbilt University course, <a href="https://www.coursera.org/course/mobilecloud" title="Link: https://www.coursera.org/course/mobilecloud">
Programming Cloud Services for Android Handheld Systems</a> will focus on connecting Android mobile devices to cloud computing and data storage resources, essentially turning a device into an extension of powerful cloud-based services on popular cloud computing platforms, such as Google App Engine and Amazon EC2. That course is currently scheduled to begin in early June 2014.</p><p>Nevertheless, each of these courses stands alone. Students are not required to take all of them. Those who do, however, will gain a much more detailed, end-to-end understanding of handheld systems and their applications.</p>

Title:  Asset Pricing
Short desc:  This course is an introductory survey of graduate-level academic asset pricing. We will focus on building the intuition and deep understanding of how the theory works, how to use it, and how to connect it to empirical facts.


Long desc:  <div>Are you curious about quantitative academic finance? Have you considered graduate study in finance? Are you working in an investment bank, money-management firm or hedge fund and you want to understand models better? Would you like to know what buzzwords like beta, risk premium, risk-neutral price, arbitrage, and discount factor mean? This class is for you. <br><br>We will see how one basic idea, price equals expected discounted payoff, unites everything - models that describe stocks, bonds, options, real investments, discrete time, continuous time, asset pricing, portfolio theory, and so forth. </div><div><br></div><div>We'll start with the underlying consumption-based model, and we’ll preview the classic issues in finance. We’ll think about asset pricing in a simple economic equilibrium. Then, we'll take a step back and study contingent claims and the theorems showing the existence of a discount factor (the m in p=E(mx)). We'll explore the mean-variance frontier and expected return vs. beta models and factor structures. A brief tour of current facts and puzzles follows. Then, off to study options and the Black-Scholes formula, bond pricing models and facts. We will close with modern portfolio theory. </div><div><br></div><div>The math in real finance is not actually that hard. Understanding how to use the equations, and see what they really mean about the world... that's hard, and that's what I hope will be uniquely rewarding about this class.</div>

Title:  Understanding and Improving the US Healthcare System
Short desc:  In this course, you will learn about the structure, accomplishments, and shortcomings of the US healthcare system, and how those have prompted attempts at reform.  You will also take part in a unique, national group exercise, designed to help you understand how you can improve the US healthcare system.
Long desc:  <p>Health is important to everyone.&nbsp; For most people, that means that
understanding the healthcare system is important.&nbsp; As a patient or a caregiver for a loved one,
your understanding of the system can mean everything from getting the right
help, to economic stress in paying medical bills, to medical misadventures and
even death.&nbsp; And if you’re a healthcare
professional (or are in training or want to be a healthcare professional someday),
understanding the system is a critical – but often under-developed – part of
optimizing the help you can provide your community.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Despite this importance, an understanding of the US
healthcare system is alarmingly rare.&nbsp;
This course is designed to change that – by helping students understand
the core structure and accomplishments of the system, the recurring
shortcomings, and attempted remedies through policy reform.&nbsp; Rather than emphasizing complexity (a focus
of many other courses about healthcare policy), the lessons in this course will
highlight central themes that learners can take away from the course and apply
to their own experiences – and other coursework – with confidence.&nbsp; Moreover, students who seek more advanced
content will have ample opportunity to tailor their learning accordingly.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>In addition, through a unique, national group exercise
that will serve as a keystone of this course, all learners will have the
opportunity to learn how they can improve the US healthcare system.&nbsp; Whether as individuals, in groups, or as future
architects of system reform, students in this course will enjoy a premier
opportunity to understand the US healthcare system – and their options for addressing
problems in the system – as they never have before. &nbsp;This course is produced by Michael Rubyan, MPH, one of Dr. Davis's former students at the University of Michigan.</p>

Title:  Web Intelligence and Big Data
Short desc:  This course is about building 'web-intelligence' applications exploiting big data sources arising social media, mobile devices and sensors, using new big-data platforms based on the 'map-reduce' parallel programming paradigm. During the fall semester this course is offered at the Indian Institute of Technology Delhi as well as the Indraprastha Institute of Information Technology Delhi. 
Long desc:  The past decade has witnessed the successful of application of many AI techniques used at `web-scale’, on what are popularly referred to as big data platforms based on the map-reduce parallel computing paradigm and associated technologies such as distributed file systems, no-SQL databases and stream computing engines. Online advertising, machine translation, natural language understanding, sentiment mining, personalized medicine, and national security are some examples of such AI-based web-intelligence applications that are already in the public eye. Others, though less apparent, impact the operations of large enterprises from sales and marketing to manufacturing and supply chains. In this course we explore some such applications, the AI/statistical techniques that make them possible, along with parallel implementations using map-reduce and related platforms.

Title:  Surviving Disruptive Technologies
Short desc:   The purpose of this course is to help participants and the organizations they encounter survive the waves of technological disruptions facing business, government, education and their daily lives.
Long desc:  <p><b></b></p><p>The purpose of this course is to help individuals and organizations
survive when confronted with disruptive technologies that threaten their
current way of life.&nbsp; We will look at a
general model of survival and use it to analyze companies and industries that
have failed or are close to failing.&nbsp; Examples
of companies that have not survived include Kodak, a firm over 100 years old,
Blockbuster and Borders.&nbsp;&nbsp; It is likely
that each of us has done business with all of these firms, and today Kodak and
Blockbuster are in bankruptcy and Borders has been liquidated.&nbsp; Disruptions are impacting industries like
education; Coursera and others offering these massive open online courses are a
challenge for Universities.&nbsp; In addition
to firms that have failed, we will look at some that have survived and are
doing well.&nbsp; What are their strategies
for survival?<br></p>

<p>By highlighting the reasons for the decline of firms and
industries, participants can begin to understand how to keep the same thing
from happening to them.&nbsp;&nbsp; Through the
study of successful organizations, we will try to tease out approaches to
disruptions that actually work.&nbsp; Our
ultimate objective is to develop a strategy for survival in a world confronting
one disruptive technology after another.</p>

Title:  Calculus Two: Sequences and Series
Short desc:  Calculus Two: Sequences and Series is an introduction to sequences, infinite series, convergence tests, and Taylor series.  The course emphasizes not just getting answers, but asking the question "why is this true?"
Long desc:  Sequences and Series will challenge us to think very carefully about<br>"infinity."&nbsp; What does it mean to add up an unending list of numbers?<br>How can an infinite task result in a finite answer?&nbsp; These questions<br>lead us to some very deep concepts—but also to some powerful<br>computational tools which are used not only in math but in many<br>quantitative disciplines.<br><br>This course is a first and friendly introduction to sequences, infinite<br>series, convergence tests, and Taylor series.&nbsp; It is suitable for<br>someone who has seen just a bit of calculus before.&nbsp; And since one<br>learns mathematics by doing mathematics, this course encourages you to<br>participate by providing plenty of computational problems, conceptual<br>projects, and opportunities to explain your thought process to your<br>peers.<br><br>

Title:  Understanding Terrorism and the Terrorist Threat
Short desc:  This course will explore questions relating to the who, what and how of terrorism studies by introducing students to cutting edge research and the experts investigating these topics. 
Long desc:  <p>Terrorism Studies does not fall within any
one traditional academic discipline, and it is often plagued by subjectivity
and a lack of empirical data. The National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism (START), a Department of Homeland Security Center of Excellence housed at the University of Maryland, will apply its multi-disciplinary and
mixed-method approach to research in this course, utilizing theory and quantitative
and qualitative research from a range of the social and behavioral sciences
including Criminology, Psychology, Political Science and Communications Studies.</p>



<p>The course will begin with a unit looking at
widely held myths about terrorism and utilizing empirical data to discuss the
realities of broad trends and patterns in terrorist attacks over time.  The course will then review the psychological
factors at play in individual radicalization and recruitment into terrorism,
followed by an analysis of terrorist group dynamics.  The course will next look to factors that
allow terrorist groups to successfully carry out attacks, such as propaganda,
use of media, financing, recruitment, and training.  The course will
conclude by looking at the factors that drive terrorist group
persistence/endurance versus terrorist group desistance, and will bring the
varied course concepts together through a detailed look at the case of al-Qa’ida,
including the group’s successes, failures, tactics, and strategies.  Throughout the course, students will work
with the University of Maryland’s Global Terrorism Database (GTD), the largest
database of terrorist incidents in the world, learning its capabilities and
developing basic skills in searching and displaying appropriate and accurate
sets of terrorism data.</p><p><br></p>

Title:  Introduction to Systems Biology
Short desc:  An introduction to current concepts of how cellular molecules come together to form systems, how these systems exhibit emergent properties, and how these properties are used to make cellular decisions.
Long desc:  <p>This
course will introduce the student to contemporary Systems Biology focused on
mammalian cells, their constituents and their functions. Biology is moving from molecular to modular.
As our knowledge of our genome and gene expression deepens and we develop lists
of molecules (proteins, lipids, ions) involved in cellular processes, we need
to understand how these molecules interact with each other to form modules that
act as discrete functional systems. These systems underlie core subcellular processes such as signal
transduction, transcription, motility and electrical excitability. In turn
these processes come together to exhibit cellular behaviors such as secretion,
proliferation and action potentials. What are the properties of such subcellular
and cellular systems? What are the
mechanisms by which emergent behaviors of systems arise? What types of experiments inform systems-level
thinking? Why do we need computation and simulations to understand these
systems?</p>

<p>The course will develop multiple lines of
reasoning to answer the questions listed above. Two major reasoning threads
are: the design, execution and interpretation of multivariable experiments that
produce large data sets; quantitative reasoning, models and simulations. Examples will be discussed to demonstrate
“how” cell- level functions arise and “why” mechanistic knowledge allows us to
predict cellular behaviors leading to disease states and drug responses.<br></p>

Title:  Chemistry: Concept Development and Application Part II
Short desc:  This course is the second semester of the two semester sequence, Chemistry Concept Development and Application.  This course will cover the topics of a typical second semester General Chemistry course at most colleges and universities.  We will use the Chemistry Concept Development Study approach, developed and used in our courses at Rice and used in Part I of this course.
Long desc:  <p>This course will cover the second half of an introduction to General Chemistry, including properties of matter, phase transition and equilibrium, solution equilibrium, reaction rates and kinetics, reaction equilibrium, acid-base equilibrium and thermodynamics. &nbsp;We will&nbsp;use a free on-line textbook, Concept Development Studies in Chemistry, available via Rice’s Connexions project.&nbsp;</p><p>The fundamental concepts in the course will be introduced via the <i>Concept Development Approach</i>&nbsp;developed at Rice University. &nbsp;In this approach, we will develop the concepts you need to know from experimental observations and scientific reasoning&nbsp;rather than simply telling you the concepts and then asking you to simply memorize or apply them.</p><p>So why use this approach?&nbsp;<br></p><p>One reason is that most of us are inductive learners, meaning that we like to make specific observations and then generalize from there.&nbsp; Many of the most significant concepts in Chemistry are counter-intuitive.&nbsp; When we see where those concepts come from, we can more readily accept them, explain them, and apply them.&nbsp;</p><p>A second reason is that scientific reasoning in general and Chemistry reasoning in particular are inductive processes.&nbsp; This Concept Development approach illustrates those reasoning processes.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>A third reason is that this is simply more interesting! The structure and reactions of matter are fascinating puzzles to be solved by observation and reasoning.&nbsp; It is more fun intellectually when we can solve those puzzles together, rather than simply have the answers to the riddles revealed at the outset.</p>

Title:  Going Out on a Limb: The Anatomy of the Upper Limb
Short desc:  This course explores musculoskeletal anatomy of the Upper Limb, and common injuries that affect its function. We discuss parts of the upper limb, the anatomy of bones, joints and muscles, nerve injuries and common pathologies.
Long desc:  In the first six weeks of the course, we begin with an introduction to the parts of the upper limb and a discussion of the anatomic position, including the three-dimensional planes in which body movements are performed. Next, we cover the osteology of
the upper limb by describing the bones of the extremity, how they articulate at synovial joints, and the movements that are possible at these joints. We explore the blood supply and innervation to the upper limb. We then discuss the major muscles that
act at each joint, pointing out what muscles allow us to shrug our shoulders, row a boat, make a fist, and rotate our hand forwards or backwards.
<br>
<br>In the final three weeks of the course, we investigate nerve injuries that occur in the upper limb and their clinical effects. We also explore common pathologies that appear in the extremity, such as rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, gout, and Dupuytren's
contracture. We finish with a description of the embryologic development of the upper limb and common causes of limb malformations and deformations.
<br>

Title:  Introduction to Systematic Program Design - Part 1
Short desc:  This course is about learning to program well: building programs that are elegant, well tested and easy to maintain.  The course is designed for students with no programming experience at all. Nonetheless, former students who already knew how to program have said it made them better programmers.
Long desc:  <p>Phones, diesel engines, animated newspapers, medical devices, games, political
    campaigns, medical research, mining, transportation systems, ... and so
    on, and on, and on... every day more of the world around us is at least
    partly run by computer programs. This means that being able to design programs
    - or at least be able to work with people who design programs - is becoming
    a more and more valuable skill.</p>
<p>To build your own programs you need to know two things: how to use the
    specific programming language and libraries needed, and the more general
    skill of how to design a program.</p>
<p>This course presents a <b>design method</b> that will enable you to approach
    the design of complex programs systematically. The method will work for
    programs in this course as well as hard to design programs you develop
    in the future.</p>
<p>Using this method you will learn how to model the information in a problem
    domain, how to structure program data to mirror that information and how
    to further structure the data to lead to a well organized program. You
    will also learn to distinguish those parts of a program that are naturally
    data driven, from those that should use an alternative algorithmic approach.
    The method uses unit-tests to both produce a better developed design, and
    to test your program as you develop it.</p>
<p>In the first course -- Part 1 -- we use a simple
    teaching language to cover the core of the design method. In Part 1 we cover various forms of data; simple interactive programs like games and animations; storing information in and rendering trees; and finally exploring search programs: programs that solve puzzles like Sudoku boards.&nbsp;</p><p>A second phase of the course, to be offered later, &nbsp;will consist of parallel tracks, with each track using a different popular
    programming language and focusing on a different kind of problem. This
    will help you bring the design method to whatever language and problem
    domain interests you.<br></p>

Title:  Networks: Friends, Money, and Bytes
Short desc:  A course driven by 20 practical questions about wireless, web, and the Internet, about how products from companies like Apple, Google, Facebook, Netflix, Amazon, Ericsson, HP, Skype and AT&T work.

In this offering, we will cover 7 of the 20 questions, and you will have the opportunity to personalize your own learning experience by choosing which of the versions suits you best.
Long desc:  You pick up your iPhone while waiting in line at a coffee shop. You google a not-so-famous actor, get linked to a Wikipedia entry listing his recent movies and popular YouTube clips of several of them. You check out user reviews on Amazon and pick one,
download that movie on BitTorrent or stream that in Netflix. But suddenly the WiFi logo on your phone is gone and you're on 3G. Video quality starts to degrade, but you don't know if it's the server getting crowded or the Internet is congested somewhere.
In any case, it costs you $10 per Gigabyte, and you decide to stop watching the movie, and instead multitask between sending tweets and calling your friend on Skype, while songs stream from iCloud to your phone. You're happy with the call quality, but
get a little irritated when you see there're no new followers on Twitter. You may wonder how they all kind of work, and why sometimes they don't. Take a look at the list of 20 questions below. Each question is selected not just for its relevance to our
daily lives, but also for the core concepts in the field of networking illustrated by its answers. This course is about formulating and answering some of these 20 questions.

Title:  Introductory Physics I with Laboratory
Short desc:  Explore motion in the real world using modern tools and techniques (video capture and analysis, computer modeling) guided by fundamental physics principles.
Long desc:  <div>
    <p>We will investigate motion in the world around us; we welcome both those
        who want to participate fully and those who wish to sample, cafeteria-style,
        the activities of this course. &nbsp;Those who participate fully will experience
        a course that is very different in style but equivalent (at least) in core
        content to a traditional, on-campus, first-semester college-level introductory
        physics course that includes a laboratory. At the same time, those who
        cherry-pick selected course elements (e.g., learning the basics of video
        capture and analysis of motion in one’s own surroundings) will still advance
        their understanding of physics. &nbsp;&nbsp;
        <br>
    </p>
    <p>We aim to understand and to predict motion in the real world using a small
        set of powerful fundamental principles. The laboratories are the backbone
        of this course, providing opportunities (1) to observe and to analyze motion
        in our own surroundings, (2) to apply fundamental principles to build explanations
        of the motion, and (3) to evaluate, in a constructively critical way, our
        own measurements and models, as well as the measurements and models of
        our course peers. Other course elements (lecture videos with “clicker”
        questions, homework) support and extend the physics explored in the laboratories.</p>Participants
    who satisfactorily complete the course will be eligible for six (6) Continuing
    Education Units from the American Association of Physics Teachers.&nbsp;</div>

Title:  Water Supply and Sanitation Policy in Developing Countries
Short desc:  This course will examine current conditions and trends in water and sanitation services in the Global South. Within it we will take a critical look at the underlying political, economic, social, and technical reasons why almost a billion people lack access to improved water supplies and almost 2 billion still do not have improved sanitation services.
Long desc:  <p><span>This <b>first module in the two module course sequence</b> critically examines
the consequences of current water and sanitation conditions, including over 2
million deaths annually due to water-related diseases, millions of dollars in
avoidable health care expenditures, and billions of hours spent carrying water
from sources outside the home. Reducing such costs associated with poor water
and sanitation services is one of the major challenges for States in the Global
South in the 21st century. The technologies to provide networked water
and sanitation services are well-known, as are many low-cost, non-network
solutions that would appear affordable to many poor households in developing
countries. For decades the international community and national governments
have struggled to find institutional and financial arrangements to provide
these technologies to households and businesses in developing countries, with
mixed success. Although progress is being made in many parts of the world,
millions of households in Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia still face a
lifetime without the improved water and sanitation services that citizens in
industrialized countries take for granted. </span></p>

<p>The <b>second module</b> will focus on what can be done to solve global water
and sanitation problems. We will examine the main strategies that donors and
national governments have tried to change status quo water and sanitation
conditions, and the lessons learned from these experiences. </p>

Title:  Introduction to Physical Chemistry
Short desc:  Gain a rigorous introduction to physical chemistry suitable for undergraduates starting university. The course provides a unique, in-depth introduction to the three main pillars of physical chemistry: thermodynamics, kinetics and quantum mechanics.

Long desc:  Chemical
reactions underpin the production of pretty much everything in our modern
world.  But, what is the driving force
behind reactions?  Why do some reactions
occur over geological time scales whilst others are so fast that we need
femtosecond-pulsed lasers to study them? 
Ultimately, what is going on at the atomic level?  Discover the answers to such
fundamental questions and more on this course in introductory physical chemistry.  <br><br>The
course covers the key concepts of three of the principal topics in first-year
undergraduate physical chemistry: thermodynamics, kinetics and quantum
mechanics. These three topics cover whether or not reactions occur, how fast
they go and what is actually going on at the sub-atomic scale.<br><br>

Title:  Global Health and Humanitarianism
Short desc:  Is humanitarianism an effective, justifiable and sustainable response to ill-health, inequality, injustice and war?
Long desc:  <p></p>

<p>Global health is public health at the global level. It deals
with the interconnections between peoples from all over the world. It is based
on the idea that it is necessary to cooperate internationally to respond to diseases,
disasters and conflicts which now threaten us all. Humanitarianism, in all its
various forms, is one such response.  In
attempting to organise a humanitarian intervention, though, we are confronted
by a wide range of problems. Most acute of these is the intense inequality
which marks the contemporary world. Public health – its capacities, delivery
structures and finances – is profoundly different for the 1 billion people who
live in the world’s wealthier countries. Those elsewhere have much more limited
access to publicly funded or privately insured medicine. As a consequence,
non-governmental humanitarian organisations now deliver a large proportion of
the world’s health care.</p>This course introduces these issues by looking first at the
vague, yet highly contested, notion a global health agenda. It then goes on to
consider how and why the world’s wealthier countries have sought to develop a
response to the emergencies and crises that the vulnerabilities of others have
produced. Here, public pressure and the ethical imperative to bear witness when
confronted with such suffering are especially important. Finally, the course
considers whether or not humanitarian assistance can be considered a right. It
looks at the emerging Responsibility to Protect agenda and the associated moral
dilemmas around sovereignty, post-colonialism and duty-based ethics.

<p> Within this context, the course explores these critical normative
and logistical questions:</p>

<ul><li>  Is humanitarian
aid as a concept, as simple as the rich helping the poor?</li><li> Are these
interventions well-meaning and effective? </li><li>  Should governments
be committing tax revenues – involuntarily given – to improve the health of

<p>Each of the 3 sessions below is built around a series of
interviews with 3 leading figures in the humanitarian world. The first,
Professor Tony Redmond OBE, is a Consultant in Emergency Medicine and a
founding member of the College of Emergency Medicine. He was founding Editor of
the Emergency Medicine Journal and a founder the Resuscitation Council. His
interest in disaster management began with the earthquake in Armenia in 1988
(where he was appointed to the Soviet Order for Personal Courage) and he has since
responded to a range of humanitarian crises in Kurdistan, Bosnia, Serbia,
Macedonia, Montenegro, Cape Verde, Kosovo, Kenya, Iran, Pakistan, China and
Haiti. In 1994 he established UK-Med, an NGO that now hosts the
UK International Emergency Trauma Register. He is currently Professor of
Emergency Medicine at the Humanitarian and Conflict Response Institute at the
University of Manchester and Chair of the Foreign Medical Teams Working Group
at the World health Organisation.</p>

<p>The second, Professor Rony Brauman, is Director of the
Humanitarian and Conflict Response Institute at the University of Manchester.
He has worked in the field of international medical assistance since 1977. He
has served as a field physician in Thailand, Chad, Somalia, El Salvador,
Nicaragua, Lebanon, Angola, Somalia, Afghanistan, primarily with Médecins San
Frontières (France). He became the President of the organization from 1982
-1994. During this period, MSF became recognized as the largest and the most
effective transnational not-for-profit medical agency in the world and was
awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1999. He was awarded the "Prix Henry
Dunant" in 1997 and currently lectures at the Institut d'Études Politiques
(Paris) and is Director of Research at the MSF Foundation also in Paris.</p>

<p> The third, Professor Mukesh Kapila CBE, is Professor of
Global Health and Humanitarian Affairs in the Humanitarian and Conflict Response
Institute at the University of Manchester. He is also Special Representative of
the Aegis Trust and Chair of Minority Rights Group International. Previously,
he was Under Secretary General at the International Federation of Red Cross and
Red Crescent Societies. Earlier, he served as Special Adviser to the United
Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights in Geneva and then to the UN Mission
in Afghanistan. Subsequently, he led the UN’s largest country mission at the
time as the United Nations Resident and Humanitarian Coordinator for the Sudan,
and then became a Director at the World Health Organization. Prior to the UN,
Professor Kapila was at the UK's Department for International Development,
initially as senior health and population adviser and latterly as the first
head of a new Conflict and Humanitarian Affairs Department that he set up.<br></p>

Title:  An Introduction to Population Health
Short desc:  This MOOC is aimed at anyone wishing to understand the basics of population health. Our aim is to prompt any participant to reconsider the decisions they make about their own health or the health of others (if they are taking the course as a health professional).
Long desc:  <p>It is
understandable that most of us consider our health care as something provided
to us as an individual by other individuals or teams, for example our doctor,
midwife, nurse or dentist. But in this short course we wish to introduce to you
a different perspective, that of population health. </p>

<p>Our starting
premise is that having an understanding of health from a population level can
enable people to make better decisions about their own health care and can also
enable health workers to make better decisions about individuals and populations
within their care.</p>

<p>The course is led by Aneez Esmail, a general practitioner and professor from The University of Manchester, UK. Together, he and Dr Katie Reed, the Faculty eLearning lead, developed the course with contributions from a number of other academic and technical staff from the Faculty of Medical and Human Sciences.<br></p>

Title:  Matemáticas y Movimiento
Short desc:  El curso propone un acercamiento a la Matemática Preuniversitaria donde el contexto del movimiento en línea recta dará significado al conocimiento y la tecnología será el medio para interactuar con el mismo.
Long desc:  <p>En este curso
vamos a considerar el contexto real del movimiento en línea recta para dar
cabida a ideas y nociones importantes del Cálculo. </p><p>El
curso se restringe al conocimiento de algunos modelos matemáticos con los
cuales quedará clara de un modo general la visión del Cálculo como la
Matemática que estudia el cambio y la variación. En este sentido, la idea de
derivada y su cálculo para diferentes tipos de funciones de una variable real forma
parte del curso.</p>

<p>A través del
análisis de diferentes tipos de movimiento realizados por un “personaje” sobre
una recta horizontal, la relación entre las gráficas de velocidad y de posición
del movimiento con respecto al tiempo, aparecerán ante nuestra vista como la
representación matemática que invita a interpretar lo que está sucediendo con
el movimiento en cuestión.</p>

<p>Algunos
conocimientos algebraicos y geométricos que corresponden con ecuaciones y
funciones lineales, cuadráticas y cúbicas van a ser retomados decididamente durante
el curso, y esto para dar respuesta a diferentes preguntas que surgen del
movimiento rectilíneo en cuestión.</p>

<p>Será de este modo que se podrá interactuar combinando las diferentes representaciones
matemáticas (numérica, algebraica y gráfica) en el afán por entender la
situación real considerada.</p>

<p>En este curso
se hará un uso pleno de tecnologías digitales para la graficación y de software
especializado en conocimiento matemático del cual se puede hacer uso de manera
libre en la actualidad. Las prácticas
que buscan consolidar el aprendizaje integran el uso de estos recursos también, brindando a la
vez la oportunidad de ver en la tecnología digital un aliado en la interacción
con la Matemática y nuestro pensamiento.</p>

El curso puede
considerarse como una preparación al Cálculo en el nivel universitario; no
obstante, busca ofrecer a cualquier persona un acercamiento a la Matemática
diferente, donde números, letras, fórmulas y gráficas se entrelazan en un
razonamiento coherente. Es una oportunidad para todo aquel que busca hacer del
razonamiento matemático una forma de pensar y actuar.

Title:  Health for All Through Primary Health Care
Short desc:  This course explores why primary health care is central for achieving Health for All. It provides examples of how primary health care has been instrumental in approaching this goal in selected populations and how the principles of primary health care can guide future policies and actions.
Long desc:  Two of the most inspiring, least understood, and most often derided terms
in global health discourse are “Health for All” and “Primary Health Care.”
In this course, we will explore these terms in the context of global health,
their origins and meanings, the principles upon which they rest, and examples
of how these principles have been implemented both at small scale as well
as at large scale. We will also explore some ultra-low-cost approaches
to Health for All through primary health care and the promise that primary
health care holds for eventually achieving Health for All.
<br>
<br>The course consists of six one-hour lectures with readings and opportunities
for discussions among those taking the course and interactions with the
professor.

Title:  TechniCity
Short desc:  We live in real-time, technologically enhanced cities. <br>Explore the sweeping changes that our cities are undergoing as a result of networks, sensors, and communication technology.
Long desc:  <b></b>We are part of the 'TechniCity'. The increasing availability of
networks, sensors and mobile technologies allows for new approaches to
address the challenges that our cities face. The way we understand cities
is undergoing sweeping transformation, right along with the analytical
tools we use to design our cities and the communication tools we use to
engage people. Absorbing, studying and understanding the role of technology
from a critical viewpoint allows us to generate creative ideas for improving
our cities. 
<br>
<br>This course begins by examining how our cities are changing. We then jump
into how technology is used to engage with the public to support decision-making and the creative ways that every-day people are using technology to improve their cities.  
Students will be examining tools for analyzing the city. Then we move into exploring the fascinating ways that cities are using real-time, technology. You'll hear from technological innovators and thought leaders about all of these topics. You will get to engage around a topic you are most interested in to create a project in your own city.

Title:  Software Defined Networking
Short desc:  In this course, you will learn about software defined networking and how it is changing the way communications networks are managed, maintained, and secured.
Long desc:  <span>
 <span><span>
  <span>
  <p>This
  course introduces software defined networking, an emerging paradigm in
  computer networking that allows a logically centralized software program to
  control the behavior of an entire network. &nbsp;</p>
  <p>Separating
  a network's control logic from the underlying physical routers and switches
  that forward traffic allows network operators to write high-level control
  programs that specify the behavior of an entire network, in contrast to
  conventional networks, whereby network operators must codify functionality in
  terms of low-level device configuration. &nbsp;</p>
  <p>Logically
  centralized network control makes it possible for operators to specify more
  complex tasks that involve integrating many disjoint network functions (e.g.,
  security, resource control, prioritization) into a single control framework,
  allowing network operators to create more sophisticated policies, and making
  network configurations easier to configure, manage, troubleshoot, and
  debug.&nbsp;</p>

    <br>In the weeks leading up to the 50th anniversary of the assassination, this course will explore the Presidency, assassination, and lasting legacy of President John F. Kennedy. Students will learn how 
    JFK’s life, administration, and tragic death have influenced the general public, the media, and each of the nine U.S. presidents who followed.<br><br>Understanding the Kennedy legacy
    and being able to identify elements of his legacy within the context of modern politics&nbsp;helps understand&nbsp;many of the&nbsp;vexing problems that developed over the last half century as well as many of the challenges that confront us today.&nbsp;
    &nbsp;
    <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>November 22, 1963 was so powerful a moment that in the fifty years since the assassination, every U.S. President that followed JFK has used Kennedy’s words and actions in an effort to craft their own political image. Why does Kennedy’s influence persist,
    and will it continue? What are the effects?
    <br>
    <br>We’ll address these questions and more as we explore The Kennedy Half Century.

Title:  Data Analysis
Short desc:  Learn about the most effective data analysis methods to solve problems and achieve insight.
Long desc:  <div>You have probably heard that this is the era of “Big Data”. Stories about
    companies or scientists using data to recommend movies, discover who is
    pregnant based on credit card receipts, or confirm the existence of the
    Higgs Boson regularly appear in Forbes, the Economist, the Wall Street
    Journal, and The New York Times. But how does one turn data into this type
    of insight? The answer is data analysis and applied statistics. Data analysis
    is the process of finding the right data to answer your question, understanding
    the processes underlying the data, discovering the important patterns in
    the data, and then communicating your results to have the biggest possible
    impact. There is a critical shortage of people with these skills in the
    workforce, which is why Hal Varian (Chief Economist at Google) says that
    being a statistician will be the sexy job for the next 10 years.
    <br>
    <br>This course is an applied statistics course focusing on data analysis.
    The course will begin with an overview of how to organize, perform, and
    write-up data analyses. Then we will cover some of the most popular and
    widely used statistical methods like linear regression, principal components
    analysis, cross-validation, and p-values. Instead of focusing on mathematical
    details, the lectures will be designed to help you apply these techniques
    to real data using the R statistical programming language, interpret the
    results, and diagnose potential problems in your analysis. You will also
    have the opportunity to critique and assist your fellow classmates with
    their data analyses.</div>

Title:  Villes africaines: une introduction à la planification urbaine / African cities : an introduction to urban planning
Short desc:  Le cours permet d'apprendre les bases de la planification urbaine à travers ses dimensions techniques, environnementales, sociales et économiques.

This course teaches the basics of the urban planning through its technical, environmental, societal and economical dimensions.
Long desc:  <i></i>Le cours propose une
introduction à la planification urbaine des villes africaines. Après un
passage par les grandes thématiques urbaines (changement climatique, énergie,
droit à la ville, foncier, habitat …), nous aborderons les outils actuellement

verrons ensuite comment planifier une ville "intégrative", ouverte,
respectueuse de l’environnement et faiblement consommatrice en ressources.<br><br>Parallèlement, nous aborderons
la question du financement des villes, le jeu des acteurs (gouvernance) et l’évaluation des planifications.<br><br>L’entrée du cours n’est
pas disciplinaire, mais thématique. Le cours articule les niveaux de lecture de la
ville (technique, social et symbolique) aussi bien que les thématiques urbaines
permettant de mettre en exergue les processus de fabrication de la ville.<br><br>
















<p><i>The course suggests an introduction to urban planning of African
cities. After a short overview of the big urban issues (climate change, energy,

integrative, open, environmental-friendly and low-resource-consumption city.</i></p>

<p><i>In parallel, we will approach the funding of the cities, the
governance and the assessment of the planning.</i></p>

<p><i>The approach of the course is not disciplinary, rather thematic.
The course articulates the different reading levels of the city (technical,
social and symbolic) as well as urban issues allowing to highlight the making of a city.</i></p>

Title:  Practicing Tolerance in a Religious Society: The Church and the Jews in Italy
Short desc:  What social and ideological mechanisms allowed Jews to survive and even flourish in Catholic Italy? And under what circumstances did the practice of tolerance break down? This course takes a different approach to the idea of tolerance, as well as to the long, complicated history of the Catholic Church and the Jews.
Long desc:  Discussions of the centuries-long relationship between Christianity and the Jews are almost always framed in terms of persecution and discrimination with only occasional examples of toleration and kindness. To explain or to excuse the ongoing hatred towards Jews, historians mix together terminologies and concepts drawn from religious theology, psychology, social theory and politics. The catch-all term "anti-Semitism" lumps together outbreaks of prejudice and victimization in different times and places.<br><br>In this course, we shall ask a different question. Our focus is not on why a majority society saw Jews as different or reacted with violence to Jews' "otherness." Rather, we ask how in a society dedicated to religious uniformity one group of people was tolerated even though it refused to join the dominant faith. Many modern writers assume that Christianity, and perhaps religion itself, is inherently intolerant of non-believers. But we will see that neither religious nor secular world views necessarily lead to toleration or discrimination. The patterns of Christian-Jewish relations are both complex and intriguing.<br><br>Our question then is how did a religious society manage to practice tolerance, and under what circumstances did that practice break down? We will focus on the history of Jews in Italy and especially Rome, the city that housed the the longest continuous Jewish settlement in world history and that was also, for most of the past two millennia, the home of the Catholic Church.<br>

Title:  History of Rock, Part One
Short desc:  Learn about the early days of rock music, from the pre-rock years of the post World War II era through the birth of rock in the mid 1950s to the psychedelic era of the late 1960s.
Long desc:  This course, part 1 of a 2-course sequence, examines the&nbsp;history of rock, primarily&nbsp;as it unfolded in the United States,&nbsp;from the days before rock (pre-1955) to the end of the 1960s. This course covers the music of Elvis Presley, Chuck Berry, Phil Spector,&nbsp;Bob Dylan, the Beatles, the Rolling Stones, Jimi Hendrix, Cream, and many more artists, with an emphasis both on cultural context and on the music itself. We will also explore how developments in&nbsp;the music business and in technology helped shape the ways in which styles developed.&nbsp;<br><br>Rock emerged in the mid 1950s as a blending of mainstream pop, rhythm and blues, and country and western--styles that previously&nbsp;had remained relatively separate. This new style became the music of the emerging youth culture and was often associated with teen rebellion. We will follow the story of how this rowdy first wave of rock and roll (1955-59) was tamed in the early 60s but came roaring back with the Beatles and the Rolling Stones and then went psychedelic&nbsp;by the end of the decade.

Title:  Éléments de Géomatique
Short desc:  Le but de ce cours de base en géomatique est de présenter un aperçu des méthodes d'acquisition, de modélisation et de représentation des données à référence spatiale. Les ingénieurs civils et en environnement devront comprendre le rôle et les enjeux de la géomatique face aux disciplines de la construction, de l'aménagement et de l'environnement.
Long desc:  <p>Les nouvelles technologies de
l’information ont facilité l’accès à de nombreuses bases de données offrant au
grand public, mais surtout aux professionnels une multitude de services. Le
domaine de<b> l’information géographique</b> a également suivi ce mouvement en
modernisant l’ensemble des supports, des plans, des cartes topographiques et de
tous les types de données à référence spatiale.<br></p>

<p>Face au déploiement massif des
cartes numériques, des globes virtuels et des nombreux services basés sur la
localisation, il s’agit de rester critique et surtout de développer les
capacités nécessaires afin de choisir les outils et jeux de géodonnées adaptés
à nos besoins professionnels. </p><p>C’est dans cette optique que ce cours propose de développer les éléments fondamentaux de la géomatique en décrivant les domaines
clés que sont:</p><p></p><ul><li>les références géodésiques <br></li><li>les techniques d’acquisition des géodonnées <br></li><li>les instruments de topométrie terrestre<br></li><li>les méthodes de localisation par satellites</li><li>la modélisation et la représentation du terrain.</li></ul><p></p>



<p>C'est enseignement est proposé aux futurs ingénieurs et architectes et quels que soient les métiers de ces filières, le recours aux bases de données spatiales et géodonnées est
incontournable pour la réalisation de projets d’aménagement, de construction, de
gestion de l’environnement, de transport et de développement territorial. Dans
ces domaines, l’accès aux données à référence spatiale ainsi qu’une
connaissance des sources d’information et de leur qualité sont donc primordiales pour la conduite de projets.</p>

Title:  The Music of the Beatles
Short desc:  The Music of the Beatles will track the musical development of the band, starting from the earliest days in Liverpool and Hamburg, moving through the excitement of Beatlemania, the rush of psychedelia, and the musical maturity of Abbey Road. 
Long desc:  The Music of the Beatles will track the musical development of the band, starting from the earliest days in Liverpool and Hamburg, moving through the excitement of Beatlemania, the rush of psychedelia, and the maturity of Abbey Road. While the focus will be on the music, we will also consider how recording techniques, the music business, the music of other artists, and the culture of the 1960s affected John, Paul, George, and Ringo as they created the Beatles repertory.<br><br>There is probably no band or artist that has had more written about their music than the Beatles. There are many good books on the band's biography, several insider accounts offering glimpses behind the scenes, books that interpret the meaning of the songs, and even books that catalog dates and people regarding the band. This course will try to synthesize much of that information into an account of the Beatles' development as musicians and songwriters.

Title:  Introduction to Clinical Neurology
Short desc:  An overview of the relevant aspects of the epidemiology, clinical presentation, basic disease mechanisms, diagnostic approaches and treatment options of the most common neurological diseases.
Long desc:  <p><b></b><b>Course Co-Directors:<br></b><b></b>Daniel Lowenstein, MD<br>Andy Josephson, MD<br>Wade Smith, MD, PhD</p><p><b></b><b>Instructors:</b><br>John Engstrom, MD<br>Jill Ostrem, MD<br>Maulik Shah, MD</p><p><span>Neurologic diseases are common and costly.
According to estimates by the World Health Organization, neurologic disorders
affect over 1 billion people worldwide<b>,</b>
constitute 12% of the global burden of disease, and cause 14% of global deaths.  Furthermore, the number of deaths caused by
neurological diseases have more than doubled in the past 10 years, and this
number will undoubtedly substantially increase in the coming years as the
average age of the world’s population increase.</span></p>

<p>This course will provide a basic overview of the
most common and important neurological diseases and conditions affecting people
worldwide: stroke, epilepsy, headache, back pain, neurodegenerative diseases,
movement disorders, alterations of consciousness, nervous system infections,
traumatic brain injury, and neuromuscular diseases.  For each topic, a neurology professor at the
University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) who has specialized knowledge
about the subject area, and who teaches this material to UCSF medical students
and other health professional students, will focus on the fundamentals of the
clinical presentation and evaluation of people with these disorders, as well as
some of the additional diagnostic approaches and options for treatment.  Although not a primary focus of the course,
the faculty will also touch on some of the most pertinent disease mechanisms to
help students appreciate the rationale for current therapies and the many
questions that need to be answered to achieve effective treatments and cures.</p>

Title:  Physique générale - mécanique
Short desc:  À l’École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne, un cours de physique générale fait partie de la formation de tous les futurs ingénieurs et scientifiques. Le présent cours de mécanique en fait partie. Il a pour but de leur apprendre à transcrire sous forme mathématique un phénomène physique, afin de pouvoir en formuler une analyse raisonnée.
Long desc:  <p>La mécanique classique est l’un
des piliers d’une formation polytechnique car elle permet de développer un
savoir-faire en traitant une variété de problèmes du point matériel et du
solide indéformable. On aborde les sujets classiques de la mécanique, comme le
phénomène de résonance, la balistique, le mouvement des planètes autour du
Soleil, et les effets associés aux référentiels accélérés. On cherche à
développer l’habitude de discerner&nbsp; les
limites des modèles&nbsp; qu’on utilise. Dans
cet esprit, on examinera aussi quels étaient les problèmes conceptuels qui ont
conduit à la théorie de la relativité restreinte.</p>

<p>L’accent sera mis sur la
méthodologie&nbsp;: l’étudiant apprendra à traiter rigoureusement un problème
donné, en choisissant judicieusement repère et référentiel et en appliquant la
ou les lois physiques adéquates afin d’obtenir les équations du mouvement.
Puis, il sera amené à discuter ces équations afin d’en tirer une solution
qualitative et/ou quantitative.</p><p></p><p>

</p><p><b>Attention</b> <b>:</b> le cours sera donné en deux sessions
parallèles. L'une aura un rythme particulièrement soutenu de deux leçons par
semaine pendant 12 semaines et correspond au rythme du cours de Physique
Générale I pour physiciens donné à l'EPFL.</p>

<p>Le rythme de la seconde session sera d'une leçon par semaine
pendant 24 semaines, correspondant ainsi à la cadence du cours de Physique
Générale pour les filières d'ingénieurs de l'EPFL. Cependant, cette seconde
session sera mise en pause durant les 8 semaines d'arrêt des cours entre le
semestre d'automne et celui de printemps, à savoir entre le 20 décembre 2013 et
le 17 février 2014.</p>

<p>Pour résumer, la session de 12 semaines (<i>rythme soutenu</i>)
commencera le vendredi 13 septembre et se terminera le 6 décembre. La session
de 24 semaines (<i>rythme normal</i>) commencera également le vendredi 13 septembre,
mais se terminera le 25 avril, avec 8 semaines de pause entre les leçons 14 et
15.</p>

Title:  Climate Literacy: Navigating Climate Change Conversations
Short desc:  Climate Literacy tackles the scientific and socio-political dimensions of climate change. This course introduces the basics of the climate system, models and predictions, human and natural impacts, mitigative and adaptive responses, and the evolution of climate policy.
Long desc:  <p>This course explores the basic concepts and terms needed to understand
    the science of climate change, and the available mitigation, adaptation
    and policy options. By the end of the course, students will be able to:</p>
<p>·&nbsp; Tell the story of our climate, describing how interactions among
    atmosphere, ocean, land, and life lead to climatic changes at all timescales</p>
<p>·&nbsp; Evaluate the likely effect of historical human fossil emissions
    and land use changes on Earth’s energy balance and climate.</p>
<p>·&nbsp; Describe the direct observations of climate change in recent decades, and articulate the evidence attributing global
    warming in this time period to human causes.</p>
<p>·&nbsp; Assess the utility - and limits - of climate models to predict
    global and regional climate change.</p>
<p>·&nbsp; Articulate the demographic, economic, technological and political
    factors that influence both humans’ impact on the climate and humans’ vulnerability
    to climate change.</p>
<p>·&nbsp; Express an informed opinion on the scope and urgency of the efforts
    needed to both mitigate and adapt to climate change.</p>
<p>&nbsp;We provide the scientific basics of climate change paired with the
    response options (mitigation and adaptation) and policy landscape. Focusing
    exclusively on the science of climate change may not allow a nuanced understanding
    of the social implications of this science.&nbsp; Similarly, political
    or economic analyses of climate change frequently neglect the underlying
    mechanics behind climate change thresholds, feedbacks, and the potential
    for abrupt change. This course explores linkages between climate change
    and other pressing priorities such as human health, poverty, community
    livability, economic resilience, and other environmental problems (such
    as biodiversity and water quality).&nbsp; We acknowledge the urgent need
    to design innovative strategies that realize multiple objectives (or co-benefits)
    simultaneously, and explore the particular capacity for sustainability
    and climate change to provide an avenue for achieving these objectives.&nbsp;</p>

Title:  An Introduction to Operations Management
Short desc:  This course will teach you how to analyze and improve business processes, be it in services or in manufacturing. You will learn how to improve productivity, how to provide more choice to customers, how to reduce response times, and how to improve quality.
Long desc:  <p><b>PART OF THE WHARTON FOUNDATION SERIES</b>&nbsp;
</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Remember the last time you went to a restaurant. What did you expect from that restaurant? You wanted to find something on the menu that you liked, you wanted the meal to be prepared according to high quality standards, you wanted to get it quickly and
    didn’t want to pay too much money for it. Now, remember the last time you went to a doctor’s office or a hospital. What did you want the doctors and nurses to do? You wanted them to provide the right care for you, you wanted the care delivered with
    great quality, you wanted to get the care quickly, and you (or your insurance) didn’t want to pay too much for it.
    <br>
    <br>Put differently, the management skills that you need to run the operations of a restaurant are the same that you need to run a hospital. And these are the skills you will learn in this course. Specifically, you will learn how to improve productivity,
    increase responsiveness, provide more choice to the customer, and deliver higher quality standards. In short, you will learn how to analyze business processes and how to improve them. Along the way, you will learn about topics such as Lean Operations,
    Six Sigma, and the Toyota production system, you will hear about bottlenecks, flows rates, and inventory levels. And, much, much more.</p>

Long desc:  <b>This course explores the development of web application architectures from an engineering perspective.</b>&nbsp; We will consider the fundamental design patterns and philosophies associated with modern web application architectures, along with their major components. &nbsp;By the end of this course, I expect you to be able to:<br><ul><li><b></b><b></b><b></b><b></b><b>Design, develop and deploy a modern web application. </b>&nbsp;This course is <i>not</i> about how to build a pretty web page, it's about how to build and deploy the full stack of protocols and technologies associated with a complete web app. &nbsp;That said, it is not possible for you to become an expert in this area in a few weeks. My goal, rather, is to put you on the right path by providing a solid foundation and framework for understanding web applications, allowing you to dig deeper and learn more on your own. The next bullet points describe how we're going to do this.</li><li><b>Understand the major architectural components in web apps, and how they fit together.</b> &nbsp;Modern web apps are complex. &nbsp;A typical application has a database along with numerous scripts on one end of the web stack, a web server in the middle that delivers information over the Internet, and a user's browser on the other end of the web stack. &nbsp;Even getting started in trying to understand these components can be overwhelming. Consider just the programming languages involved in a typical web stack: from the database (SQL), to the web server (scripting language), to the browser (JavaScript, HTML, CSS), we're dealing with five different programming languages, not to mention the protocols they're operating over

















–&nbsp;and you need to know a little about them too! We'll introduce a number of software design patterns throughout the course that are aimed at helping you to manage this complexity.</li><li><b>Use Ruby on Rails.</b> &nbsp;We're going to learn about web apps through the Ruby on Rails framework.&nbsp;

















Rails is a framework for creating web
applications that is built on top of the Ruby programming language.&nbsp;I believe this is one of the best frameworks
for learning about web applications, and it's also proving highly successful as
a platform for commercial offerings.&nbsp;
That said, there are many other frameworks available, and the concepts
you will learn using Rails are transferable to these other frameworks.</li><li>














<b>Better understand modern software engineering
practice.&nbsp; </b>We’ll be using the latest tools and practices in
software development, source code control, testing, and application
deployment.&nbsp;This will include exposure
to agile development practices, the numerous tools that software engineers are expected to know how to use, and the cloud-based resources that are
becoming increasingly important in web applications.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li></ul>

Title:  Exploring Quantum Physics
Short desc:  An introduction to quantum physics with emphasis on topics at the frontiers of research, and developing understanding through exercise.
Long desc:  <p>Quantum
physics is the foundation for much of modern technology, provides the framework
for understanding light and matter from the subatomic to macroscopic domains,
and makes possible the most precise measurements ever made.&nbsp; More than just a theory, it offers a way of
looking at the world that grows richer with experience and practice.&nbsp; Our course will provide some of that practice and teach 
you "tricks of the trade" (not found in textbooks) that will enable you 
to solve quantum-mechanical problems yourself and understand the subject
 at a deeper level.</p>

<p>The
basic principles of quantum physics are actually quite simple, but they lead to
astonishing outcomes. &nbsp;Two examples that
we will look at from various perspectives are the prediction of the laser by
Albert Einstein in 1917 and the prediction of antimatter by Paul Dirac in 1928.&nbsp; Both of these predictions came from very
simple arguments in quantum theory, and led to results that transformed science
and society.&nbsp; Another familiar
phenomenon, magnetism, had been known since antiquity, but only with the advent
of quantum physics was it understood how magnets worked, to a degree that made
possible the discovery in the 1980’s of ultrastrong rare-earth magnets.&nbsp; However, lasers, antimatter and magnets are
areas of vibrant research, and they are all encountered in the new field of
ultracold atomic physics that will provide much of the material of “Exploring
Quantum Physics”.</p>

<p>Richard
Feynman once said, “I think I can safely say that nobody understands quantum
mechanics.”&nbsp; We say, that’s no reason not
to try! What Feynman was referring to are some of the “spooky” phenomena like quantum entanglement, which are incomprehensible from the standpoint of classical physics. Even though they have been thoroughly tested by experiment, and are even being exploited for applications such as cryptography and logic processing, they still seem so counterintuitive that they give rise to extraordinary ideas such as the many-world theory. Quantum physics combines
a spectacular record of discovery and predictive success, with foundational
perplexities so severe that even Albert Einstein came to believe that it was
wrong.&nbsp; This is what makes it such an
exciting area of science!</p><br>

Title:  Genes and the Human Condition (From Behavior to Biotechnology)
Short desc:  To acquire an understanding of the fundamental concepts of genomics and biotechnology, and their implications for human biology, evolution, medicine, social policy and individual life path choices in the 21st century. 
Long desc:  <p>In this class we will cover the essentials of genomics to help you better
understand your own life (know thy genome, know thyself), and how advances in
biotechnology are radically changing the scientific landscape.</p>

<p>We will begin with some of the most basic issues
of genetics, such as the composition of genomes and how the information in them
is processed so we can get an adult human from an egg. Then we’ll see that much
of the power of genomics is in comparisons. If I only had your genome there's
not much I could do with it. But if I lined it up against a chimpanzee genome
I’d see that they are 98.5% identical. It’s that 1.5% difference that we study to
determine what makes a chimp a chimp and a human a human.  </p>

<p>In the next few years you’ll be able
to get your genome done for a few hundred dollars, and we will look at the
challenges you might face dealing with this new self-knowledge. We shall
particularly focus on behavior. How can genes predispose some of us to be nice
and others of us to be psychopaths? We will be examining behavior as a complex
unfolding of interactions between your genome and the environment. </p>

Thanks in large part to genomics we are
beginning to understand the living processes that constitute ourselves, where
we can begin to intervene to take control of our own future. We will look at
the technologies involved and the consequences of this new power. Genetic
engineering has already changed what you eat and the medicines you take, and will
likely therefore change how long you live. If we choose to genetically engineer
ourselves as some advocate then we may also change how we view ourselves as
human beings. We do not know where our ability to intervene in our own living
processes is going to lead us. Depending on your point of view that is the
promise or the threat of the era we live in. Scientists today already envisage
creating life from scratch, and we are entering a world where political considerations,
and imagination, may be the only brakes on biotechnology.

Title:  Applying Principles of Behavior in the K-12 Classroom
Short desc:  In this class you will learn how to conduct a functional behavior assessment (FBA) and apply principles of behavior in the public school classroom in order to promote positive classroom behavior and intervene effectively when faced with challenging behavior.  
Long desc:  <p>
Teachers
in the classroom today have to be equipped with a variety of tools.  Not only do they need to have subject
knowledge and the ability to effectively teach, they must also have excellent
classroom management skills.  When challenging
behavior in the classroom becomes a barrier to instruction, teachers who
understand the fundamental principles behind functional behavior assessment
(FBA) are prepared to address the behavior before it becomes so disruptive
additional resources outside the classroom are needed.   Have you ever had a student who is constantly talking out, getting out of his seat, and disturbing his classmates while you are trying to teach?  No matter how many times you say something to him the behavior persists or gets worse?    You continually ask yourself… Why does David do that?
In this course you will learn
how to determine “Why?” a student engages in challenging behavior and develop
interventions that promote positive behaviors, replacing challenging
behavior. </p><p>

</p>

<p>Whether teaching in a general education or special education setting, the key to
effective behavior intervention is the functional behavior assessment.   There are various forms of the functional behavior assessment.  We will focus on how teachers can use the direct method of functional behavior assessment as part of their classroom routine.  In this
course you will learn how to conduct an FBA.  You will learn how to analyze the FBA to determine the antecedents that set the stage for challenging behavior, and determine the function of the behavior. You will also be able to use what you learn about principles of
reinforcement,  to create a function based intervention addressing the antecedents, consequences and promoting replacement behaviors.   What you learn in
this course will help you intervene with challenging behaviors in
your classroom before they escalate into behaviors that require involvement of additional
school faculty and staff beyond your classroom.

Title:  A Brief History of Humankind
Short desc:  The course surveys the entire length of human history, from the evolution of various human species in the Stone Age up to the political and technological revolutions of the twenty-first century.
Long desc:  <p>About 2 million years ago our human
ancestors were&nbsp;insignificant animals living in a corner of Africa. Their impact on the world was no greater than
that of gorillas, zebras, or chickens. Today humans are spread all over the
world, and they are the most important animal around. The very future of life
on Earth depends on the ideas and behavior of our species. </p><p>This course will explain how we humans have conquered planet Earth, and how
we have changed our environment, our societies, and our own bodies and minds.
The aim of the course is to give students a brief but complete overview of
history, and to answer some basic historical questions such as:</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What is
religion?</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What is an
empire? </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What is
money?</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;What is
science?</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; What is
capitalism? &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Why did almost
all societies believe that women are inferior to men?</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Does
history have a direction?&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Did people
become happier as history progressed? </p><p>

Title:  Introduction to Household Water Treatment and Safe Storage
Short desc:  Learn about the most important water treatment methods at household level, successful implementation strategies and about assessing the impact of Household Water Treatment and Safe Storage (HWTS). 
Long desc:  <p>It is well known that water treatment at household level can lead to dramatic improvements in
drinking water quality. But does Household Water Treatment and Safe Storage
(HWTS) also have a global
relevance? What are the potential solution methods and how do they function? Is there a standard strategy for successful
HWTS-implementation or can we identify key components which make programs more
likely to succeed? </p>

<p>In this course, you
will learn about the public health impacts of unsafe drinking water and about different
methods to treat water at household level. The course takes a closer look at the roles of different
stakeholders, such as governments, private
sector, and NGOs. How can HWTS reach the most vulnerable populations at scale?
And how can the impact of HWTS be measured? </p>

<p>The MOOC “Introduction to Household Water Treatment and Safe Storage” will answer these questions with a series of
concrete examples from Africa, Asia and Latin America.<br></p>This MOOC is a collaboration of Sandec/Eawag and EPFL. It will be conducted in English with English and French subtitles. It is the
first course of the series “WASH in developing countries”.<br><br>

Title:  Functional Programming Principles in Scala
Short desc:  Learn about functional programming, and how it can be effectively combined with object-oriented programming. Gain practice in writing clean functional code, using the Scala programming language.
Long desc:  This course introduces the cornerstones of functional programming using the Scala programming language. Functional programming has become more and more popular in recent years because it promotes code that’s safe, concise, and elegant. Furthermore, functional programming makes it easier to write parallel code for today’s and tomorrow’s multiprocessors by replacing mutable variables and loops with powerful ways to define and compose functions. <br><br> Scala is a language that fuses functional and object-oriented programming in a practical package. It interoperates seamlessly with Java and its tools. Scala is now used in a rapidly increasing number of open source projects and companies. It provides the core infrastructure for sites such as Twitter, LinkedIn, Foursquare, Tumblr, and Klout. <br><br> In this course you will discover the elements of the functional programming style and learn how to apply them usefully in your daily programming tasks. You will also develop a solid foundation for reasoning about functional programs, by touching upon proofs of invariants and the tracing of execution symbolically. <br><br> The course is hands on; most units introduce short programs that serve as illustrations of important concepts and invite you to play with them, modifying and improving them. The course is complemented by a series of assignments, most of which are also programming projects.

Title:  Surviving Your Rookie Year of Teaching: 3 Key Ideas & High Leverage Techniques
Short desc:  Learn 3 high leverage ideas and techniques to thrive in your first (or fifteenth) year of teaching. 
Long desc:  Frustration. Hard Knocks. Sleepless nights. Tears.
<br>
<br>Those are just a few of the ways that rookie teachers describe their first
year in the profession. And those sentiments have been validated by countless
research studies that show that students, on average, learn significantly
less when they’re taught by rookies. Unfortunately, many educators believe
this is a necessary “rite of passage” – a sort of hazing that one must
experience on their path to effective teaching.
<br>
<br>We don’t believe that.
<br>
<br>Over the past 6 years, the Match Teacher Residency has developed and refined
an approach to specifically address the challenges that are unique to the
rookie teacher experience. In this four-week course, we’ll explore the
three ideas that we've found to contribute radically to success as a rookie
teacher.
<br><br><br><i>“It's been a fantastic learning experience. I've taken several Coursera courses and this one is definitely the most original and creative in its approach. I suppose its main advantage is the straightforwardness of teaching, clarity and impressive visual representation. Really looking forward to Part II, where rookie teachers may grow and develop their initial knowledge even further.”</i><br><p><i><br></i></p><p><i>“This was my first Coursera course and it was
really helpful, although I am a 12th year teacher. One can never say that
he/she can manage the class successfully every day, every hour. All the advise
was very much appreciated. Many thanks to all: Orin, Ross, and Kat. I await
your next steps!</i></p><p><i><br></i></p>

<p><i>“I am happy to report that it has come in VERY
handy in my subbing jobs, in not only helping get the classroom management
under control at the start of each period, but in keeping control for the rest
of the period.&nbsp; I even used it again yesterday, at another charter school
where I sub only occasionally, and where the students are also a handful to
manage.&nbsp; I know the regular staff noticed and saw the effects.&nbsp; So,
it seems I'm racking up points towards some good references when I do apply for
a permanent position!&nbsp; I have this course to thank for taking me from
being an ‘adequate’ sub to being an ‘outstanding’ one!”</i></p>

Title:  機器學習基石 (Machine Learning Foundations)
Short desc:  Machine learning is the study that allows computers to adaptively improve their performance with experience accumulated from the data observed. The course teaches the most fundamental algorithmic, theoretical and practical tools that any user of machine learning needs to know. [機器學習旨在讓電腦能由資料中累積的經驗來自我進步。本課程將介紹各領域中的機器學習使用者都應該知道的基礎演算法、理論及實務工具。]
Long desc:  Welcome! The instructor has decided to teach the course in Mandarin on Coursera, while the slides of the course will be in English to ease the technical illustrations. We 
hope that this choice can help introduce Machine Learning to more 
beginners in the Mandarin-speaking world. The English-written slides will not require advanced English ability to understand, though. If you can understand the following descriptions of this course, you can probably follow the slides. <b>[歡迎大家！這門課將採用英文投影片配合華文的教學講解，我們希望能藉這次華文教學的機會，將機器學習介紹給更多華人世界的入門者。課程中使用的英文投影片不會使用到艱深的英文，如果你能了解以下兩段的課程簡介，你應該也可以了解課程所使用的英文投影片。]</b><br><br>Machine learning is an exciting field with lots of applications in engineering, science, finance, and commerce. It is also a very dynamic field, where many new techniques are being designed every day, and the hot techniques and theories at times can rise and disappear rapidly. Thus, users of machine learning from other fields often face the problem of choosing or using the techniques properly. In this course, we emphasize the necessary fundamentals that give any student of machine learning a 
solid foundation, and enable him or her to exploit current techniques properly, explore 
further techniques and theories, or perhaps to contribute their own in the future.<br><br>The course roughly corresponds to the first half-semester of the National Taiwan University course "Machine Learning", and the second half-semester is expected to be on Coursera under the name "Machine Learning Techniques" soon in the future. Based on five years of teaching this popular course successfully (including winning the most prestigious teaching award of National Taiwan University) and discussing with many other scholars actively, the instructor chooses to focus on what he believes to be the core topics that every student of the subject should know. The students shall enjoy a story-like flow moving from "When Can Machines Learn" to "Why", "How" and beyond. <br><br>

Title:  History of Rock, Part Two
Short desc:  Learn about the growth of rock music, from the early 1970s through the rise of punk and disco in the late 1970s, and from the emergence of MTV, hip hop, and heavy metal in 1980s to the rebellion of Nirvana in the early 90s.
Long desc:  This course, part 2 of a 2-course sequence, examines the&nbsp;history of rock, primarily as it unfolded in the United States,&nbsp;from the early 1970s to the early 1990s. This course covers the music of Led Zeppelin, the Allman Brothers, Carole King, Bob Marley, the Sex Pistols, Donna Summer, Michael Jackson, Madonna, Prince, Metallica, Run-DMC, and Nirvana,&nbsp;and many more artists, with an emphasis both on cultural context and on the music itself. We will also explore how developments in&nbsp;the music business and in technology helped shape the ways in which styles developed.&nbsp;<br><br>Emerging out of the experimental and ambitious years of late-60s psychedelia, rock splintered into a variety of styles in the 1970s as the music business continued to expand. By the end of the decade, punk and disco had challenged the excesses of the&nbsp;hippie aesthetic, as rock became more commercially streamlined and radio friendly. The emergence and rise of MTV transformed pop music and propelled the careers of Michael jackson and Madonna, while heavy metal and hip hop dominated the late 1980s. Nirvana leads alt-rock's&nbsp;return to simplicity in the early 1990s.&nbsp;

Title:  Blended Learning:  Personalizing Education for Students
Short desc:  Blended learning is a new educational model with great potential to increase student outcomes and create exciting new roles for teachers.  In this course you will learn about the different types of blended learning and the best practices from real schools using these models.  In addition, you will develop the tools you need to build your own blended learning program.  
Long desc:  <p>Plenty of buzz exists about blended learning and its
transformational potential. But what does blended learning really mean? In this
course we will explore the different models of blended learning and dive into
key issues that impact students, teachers, and schools. Specifically, we will
look at these issues through the lens of three high-performing schools that
each use a different type of blended learning. 
A few of the key topics will include:</p>

<ul>
 <li>The role of the student
     and how to support students in the transition from traditional to blended
     learning</li>
 <li>Implications for teachers in
     their day-to-day work and overall role</li>
 <li>Impact on the way schools
     are designed including staffing models, use of time, hardware/software
     selection, and the use of data</li>
 <li>Implementation challenges,
     potential solutions, and the remaining open questions</li></ul>

<p>We will live by the attributes of blended learning in this
course, encouraging students to take quizzes at the beginning of the week to
assess their understanding and skip material they already know.  In addition, the course will culminate in
participants prototyping their own blended learning model and will have an
overall hands-on approach. </p>

<p>If you are interested in learning more about how to best
leverage technology in education and rethink the way we run schools, join this
MOOC and encourage your colleagues to do the same.  Become a part of this growing movement and
learn first-hand how blended learning can help provide students a more
personalized learning experience.  Consider signing up for the signature track so you can have a verified certificate of your completion of this course.<br></p>

Title:  The Modern World: Global History since 1760
Short desc:  This is a survey of modern history from a global perspective. It begins with the revolutions of the late 1700s, tracks the transformation of the world during the 1800s, and analyzes the cataclysms of last century, concluding with the new phase of world history we are experiencing today.
Long desc:  <p>This is a survey course in modern world history for
students, beginning or advanced, who wish to better understand how the world
got to be the way it is today. In order to understand modern history, a global
perspective is essential. This is true whether you are interested in economics,
warfare, philosophy, politics, or even pop culture. This course can therefore
be essential for students in many fields, a base equipping them with tools for
lifelong learning.  </p><p><br></p>

<p>In its current form, this course on Coursera is not offered
for college credit. But it is a vital part of the for credit course on this
topic being offered at the University of Virginia in the spring semester of
2014. Both the Coursera and the UVA students use the same online material as
a common foundation for their different learning experiences.  This is the material to survey 'what
happened' and the big questions about how to explain so many changes – some of
those questions that start with: 
"Why?"  (The students in
the UVA course then supplement this online material with a lot of additional
reading; research projects on the histories of particular communities around
the world; in-person tutorials and discussions, both with the professor and with the graduate teaching assistants; and examinations.) </p><p><br></p>

<p>It is tempting to think that if we can just understand the
big patterns, we don't have to get too caught up in the details. In this
course, though, we care about chronology. We care about individuals. Without some
careful attention to sequences of cause and effect, without tracing how big
changes come from the choices made by particular people, history can turn into
just a series of descriptions, a somewhat tiresome recitation of one thing
after another. So beyond just offering a set of remarkable stories, this course offers you training in how to
analyze a situation and how to think about problems of explaining change.</p>

Title:  Introduction to Psychology
Short desc:  This course is all about you ... your mind, your behavior, and what underlies them both.  It will be a fast paced tour of the most important experiments in psychology, one that is intended to fascinate, inform, and provoke deep thought.  Come learn about yourself with us!
Long desc:  This course will highlight the most interesting experiments within the
field of psychology, discussing the implications of those studies for our
understanding of the human mind and human behavior. &nbsp;We will explore
the brain and some of the cognitive abilities it supports like memory,
learning, attention, perception and consciousness. &nbsp;We will examine
human development - both in terms of growing up and growing old - and will
discuss the manner in which the behavior of others affect our own thoughts
and behavior. &nbsp;Finally we will discuss various forms of mental illness
and the treatments that are used to help those who suffer from them. &nbsp;
<br>
<br>The fact of the matter is that humans routinely do amazing things without
appreciating how interesting they are. &nbsp;However, we are also routinely
influenced by people and events without always being aware of those influences.
&nbsp;By the end of this course you will have gained a much better understanding
and appreciation of who you are and how you work. &nbsp;And I can guarantee
you that you'll learn things that you'll be telling your friends and family
about, things that will fundamentally change the way you think of yourself
and others. &nbsp;How can you resist that?!

Title:  Principles of Reactive Programming
Short desc:  Learn how to write composable software that is event-driven, scalable under load, resilient and responsive in the presence of failures. Model systems after human organizations or inter-human communication.
Long desc:  <p>This is a follow-on for the Coursera class “Principles of Functional Programming in Scala”, which so far had more than 100’000 inscriptions over two iterations of the course, with some of the highest completion rates of any massive open online course worldwide.</p><p>The aim of the second course is to teach the principles of reactive programming. Reactive programming is an emerging discipline which combines concurrency and event-based and asynchronous systems. It is essential for writing any kind of web-service or distributed system and is also at the core of many high-performance concurrent systems. Reactive programming can be seen as a natural extension of higher-order functional programming to concurrent systems that deal with distributed state&nbsp;by coordinating and orchestrating asynchronous data streams exchanged by actors.</p><p>In this course you will discover key elements for writing reactive programs in a composable way. You will find out how to apply these building blocks in the construction of event-driven systems that are scalable and resilient.</p>The course is hands on; most units introduce short programs that serve as illustrations of important concepts and invite you to play with them, modifying and improving them. The course is complemented by a series of assignments, which are also programming projects.<br><br><div><b>Personalized Tutoring by Typesafe</b>: Typesafe offers supervised tutorial sessions accompanying select Coursera classes.

Long desc:  <i></i>

<p>Welcome to "Bioinformatics: Introduction and Methods" at Peking University!</p>Bioinformatics is an advanced 
interdisciplinary field of life sciences and computer sciences, both of which had seen extraordinary development in the past three decades. The 
driving force of bioinformatics is the exponentially
    growing amount of big data generated by high-throughput biological 
technologies such as next-generation sequencing. For instance, the 
genomes of human and many animals and plants have now been sequenced. The 
total amount of DNA sequenced exceeds 2,000 trillion bases and doubles 
every five months.  These "Big Data" brought unprecedented opportunities for new discoveries,
    new patterns, and new hypotheses.  At the same time, the data is heterogeneous with low signal-to-noise ratio. Handling such big data requires advanced, efficient
    and accurate computational methods and computer tools.  <br><br>Bioinformatics is a powerful new technology for the efficient 
management, search, and analysis of petabytes of biological data. It is 
also a new top-down, genome-scale, system-oriented scientific 
methodology that complements traditional experimental approaches in life
 sciences research.  In this MOOC we will teach the important concepts and methods in 
bioinformatics. We will cover the underlying algorithms starting from 
simple sequence alignment and sequence search, and move on to genome 
alignment, next-generation sequencing data analysis,
    and molecular pathway identification. We will use software and 
databases that we had developed in our own labs to illustrate how to 
develop new bioinformatics technologies. We will also use real cases to 
demonstrate how to apply bioinformatics approaches
    in life sciences research. In addition, we will try to provide a 
historical perspective of why and how some of the ideas were developed, bringing to our class a few renowned scientists to tell us about their seminal works and perspectives.<br><br>This MOOC is based on the popular "Methods in Bioinformatics" course 
that we created in 2006 and taught in every fall semester since at 
Peking University. The first run of this MOOC at Coursera in fall, 2013 had over 17,000 registered students from over 40 countries.  We hope that this MOOC can help you acquire knowledge and skills in bioinformatics that can be valuable in your future study and research.<p>

Title:  Machine Learning
Short desc:  Learn about the most effective machine learning techniques, and gain practice implementing them and getting them to work for yourself.
Long desc:  <p>Machine learning is the science of getting computers to act without being
    explicitly programmed. In the past decade, machine learning has given us
    self-driving cars, practical speech recognition, effective web search,
    and a vastly improved understanding of the human genome. Machine learning
    is so pervasive today that you probably use it dozens of times a day without
    knowing it. Many researchers also think it is the best way to make progress
    towards human-level AI. In this class, you will learn about the most effective
    machine learning techniques, and gain practice implementing them and getting
    them to work for yourself. More importantly, you'll learn about not only
    the theoretical underpinnings of learning, but also gain the practical
    know-how needed to quickly and powerfully apply these techniques to new
    problems. Finally, you'll learn about some of Silicon Valley's best practices
    in innovation as it pertains to machine learning and AI.</p>
<p>This course provides a broad introduction to machine learning, datamining,
    and statistical pattern recognition. Topics include: (i) Supervised learning
    (parametric/non-parametric algorithms, support vector machines, kernels,
    neural networks). (ii) Unsupervised learning (clustering, dimensionality
    reduction, recommender systems, deep learning). (iii) Best practices in
    machine learning (bias/variance theory; innovation process in machine learning
    and AI). The course will also draw from numerous case studies and applications,
    so that you'll also learn how to apply learning algorithms to building
    smart robots (perception, control), text understanding (web search, anti-spam),
    computer vision, medical informatics, audio, database mining, and other
    areas.</p>

Short desc:  Since Antiquity, scholars have appreciated the importance of communication: as social beings, we cannot exist without communication. The course extends beyond the boundaries of communication science itself, exploring dimensions of history, sociology and psychology. Join our class, together with people all over the world.

Long desc:  <p>Since Antiquity,
scholars have appreciated the importance of communication: as social beings, we
cannot exist without communication. We need to interact with people around us,
to make sense of the world and to position ourselves in a wider social and
cultural reality. In this course, we look at how and why communication evolved
as a science and reflect on today’s dominant paradigms. The course also extends
beyond the boundaries of communication science itself, exploring dimensions of
history, sociology and psychology. Join our class, together with people all
over the world.</p>

Introduction to Communication Science explores some of the basic 
theories, models and concepts from the fields of mass, interpersonal and
 intrapersonal communication. The course begins with a consideration of 
several basic models, subsequently progressing to the history of 
communication theory, linear effect-oriented theories, the reception 
approach and, finally, exploring theories on the production and 
reinforcement of culture through communication. <br>
<br>
Upon completion of this course, students should:<br>
•	have a knowledge of the history and development of communication science; <br>
•	have a knowledge of the dominant theoretical approaches within communication science; <br>
•	have a knowledge and understanding of the most important models and concepts in this field. <br><br>

Title:  Introduction to Music Production
Short desc:  Learn about the music production process—including recording, editing, and mixing—and the tools available to you to create contemporary music on your computer. 
Long desc:  With the recent introduction of high-quality-low-cost software and hardware, the tools of music production are now available to the masses. Albums are made in bedrooms as well as studios. On the surface this is liberating. Anyone can make an album for the low cost of a couple pieces of gear and a software package. But, if you dig deeper, you will find that it is not so easy. Producing music requires knowledge, <b></b>dedication, and creativity.<br>    <br>Knowledge is where this course comes in. No matter what kind of music you are making, there is a large set of tools that you will need to use.  Each lesson of this course will demonstrate a different set of music production tools, loosely following along the music production process of recording, editing, and mixing. <br><br>We will start with some background on the nature of sound and how we perceive it. We will then examine the components necessary to record audio into a computer, so that you understand the devices that sound must travel through in a music production process. <br>    <br>Once recorded, sound must be organized along a timeline, a process known as editing. It allows us to give the impression of perfect performances and create many of the sounds we hear in contemporary music. The contemporary editing tool is the Digital Audio Workstation (DAW),  a piece of software that stores and organizes all the assets of a musical project. We will focus on the editing tools that are essential in contemporary music production and that all DAWs provide. <br><br>After editing, sounds must be combined or mixed together, so we look to the mixing board—a very creative place if you know how to use it. We will explore the basic functionality of both hardware and software mixing boards, including volume, pan, mute, solo, busses, inserts, sends, and submixes. The mixing process, however, includes more tools than the mixing board provides on its own. Sound must also be processed, modified from its recorded state to fit the context of the music. We will look at compression, equalization, and delay, and examine the many audio effects that are offshoots of these devices and how they are used in a musical context.<br>    <br>We will then explore the synthesizer, a major tool within the production of contemporary music. Yes, great music can and will be created without the synthesizer, but learning how a synthesizer works will give you a language to describe sound. Music is a collaborative art form, so there is nothing more powerful than effective communication. <br>    <br>In the end, the music production process relies on your creativity. Creativity is a product of the mind and will stay there, unexpressed, until the right tools are used in the right way to share it with the world. If you have an idea in your head, it will take numerous steps, each with an important tool, to reach your audience. You bring the dedication and creativity, and this course will bring you the knowledge to make that happen.<br>

Title:  Jazz Improvisation
Short desc:  Learn the basic concepts of improvisation from Gary Burton, one of the most renowned improvisers in the jazz world, including the mental, melodic, and harmonic processes that contribute to the instinctive skills that an improviser puts to use when taking a solo.
Long desc:  While many people are fans of
jazz and understand that musicians are often “making up” the
notes they are playing during a performance, most people—often
including musicians, themselves, who are beginning to learn improvising—aren’t
clear about what exact processes take place to enable this to happen. The
purpose of this course is to introduce the basic concepts of modern improvisation and
how to go about mastering the different musical and mental skills involved. <br><br>Course author Gary Burton codifies a sought-after approach to improvisation that has been at the 
core of Berklee College of Music's curriculum for decades. Students who complete
this course will know what to practice and how to practice the
various aspects of improvising, in addition to understanding how the improviser spontaneously
communicates to the listeners through their musical creations.

Title:  Songwriting
Short desc:  Learn an efficient, effective process for writing songs that express your ideas and emotions, including a range of tools that revolve around the concept of prosody—the matching of lyrics and music to support your underlying message. 
Long desc:  There’s a songwriter lurking somewhere inside you, peeking
around corners, wondering if it’s safe to come out. Now it is. This course is an
invitation to let your inner songwriter step into the sunlight. All it takes is
a simple “yes” and you’ll be climbing that windy hill, marveling at the view.<br><br>If you haven’t written any or many songs, this course will show you
an efficient, effective process for tailoring songs to express your ideas and
emotions. If you have, you’ll look at your process differently, taking control
of aspects of the process you may have not noticed.<br><br>The course will start by examining the tools available to you, all
revolving around the essential concept of <i>prosody</i>. You’ll learn to use your
tools to enhance your message—to work compositionally at the same time you’re
developing your ideas.<br><br>You’ll be working both lyrically and musically, though
musically it’s not necessary that you either read music or play an instrument.
If you play, great, and you’ll be encouraged to play and record your musical
responses to the assignments. If you don’t play, the course offers you a number
of musical loops to work with. All you’ll have to do is sing your melodies over
the loops.<br><br>Assignments will ask you to post something for peer review—sometimes lyric lines or sections, sometimes
melodies, sometimes both. None of it has to be polished. The course is about writing,
not performing.<br><br>Most important, you’ll have a lot of fun.

<p>Computer, as an important tool for&nbsp;problem&nbsp;solving, has been deeply involved&nbsp;in every aspect of people’s daily lives.&nbsp;Data are the quantities on which operations are performed on computers. What is the logical relationship among data?
    How are the data stored in computers? What algorithms should be operated to solve the problems on the data? These are the questions that will be answered in “Data Structures and Algorithms”, one of the most important core courses in Computer Science.
    The course also covers fundamental data structures and classical algorithms which are widely used in the&nbsp;succeeding specialized courses,&nbsp;such as Operating Systems, Software Engineering, Database Systems, Compiler&nbsp;Principles, Computer
    Graphics and Human Computer Interaction.
</p>
<p>What is the combination of data structures and algorithms? Niklaus Wirth wrote a book titled "Algorithms + Data Structures = Programs", which points out their important roles in computing discipline:&nbsp;algorithm and data structure are two closely linked
    and indivisible parts of programming.</p>
<p>The course will follow the idea of&nbsp; “Algorithms + Data Structures = Programs”, aimed at improving&nbsp; students’ knowledge and skills of theory, abstraction and design in problem solving.&nbsp;On a solid basis of the fundamental theory, the students&nbsp;will
    analyze the problems using problem, data and algorithm abstraction. Making a tradeoff between space and time complexity, the&nbsp;students will learn how to organize data reasonably, design efficient and effective algorithms, and implement high quality
    programs, so that they can solve real-world complex problems.&nbsp;After studying this course, students should be well prepared for further study, engineering and research in computer related areas.</p>
<p>The course uses the textbook “Data Structures and Algorithms” written by Prof. Ming Zhang and two other&nbsp; coauthors. The course is appropriate for sophomore students majoring in computer science or other science/engineering disciplines. Students should&nbsp;have
    learned "introduction to computing",&nbsp;with the knowledge of structured and object-oriented programming.
</p>
<p>The course will last for 14 weeks and requires the students to study for 4-8 hours per week.&nbsp;After studying the course, the students’ ability of abstract thinking and problem solving should have improved considerably.&nbsp;Their programming skills
    and the quality of their codes would have increased as well.</p>

Title:  How to Change the World
Short desc:  How can we use the things we share in common to address some of the most challenging problems facing the world? This course examines issues concerning poverty, the environment, technology, health care, gender, education and activism to helps us understand better how to initiate positive change.
Long desc:  <p>

</p><p><i>How to Change the World</i><span> has its origins in the <a title="Link: http://mashable.com/sgs/#sgs" target="_blank" href="http://mashable.com/sgs/#sgs">Social
Good Summit</a> held at the 92nd Street Y in New York. The summit
brought together some of the world's most creative entrepreneurs, writers,
academics and political leaders to discuss ways innovative thinking and
technology can address pressing global challenges.  Beginning from talks,
panels and conversations from the summit, we will add lectures, on-line
discussion groups, hangouts and readings to explore the issues in
politics, technology and the environment in broader academic and historical
contexts. We will then discover together what actions we can take to make a
difference.    </span></p>

Title:  艺术史
Short desc:      本课程将以“中国的眼光，现代的立场”来重新阐释“世界艺术史”的概念，并具体陈述西方艺术与中国艺术在理念和创作方法上的区别，进而通过艺术史如何建造一条各文明之间互相理解、互相尊重的道路。
Long desc:  <p>     课程介绍视频可以访问<a href="http://video.study.163.com/edu-video/nos/mp4/2013/12/25/330012_hd.mp4" target="_blank">这里</a>。</p>
<p></p>
<p>    本课程将以卢浮宫的收藏为基础，先后摘取西方艺术在不同的阶段的最精彩的例证，强调各文明间有着并行同存的关系，但由于取舍不同，造就了各自的完全不同的理解和实践。课程将试以中国艺术的创作理论和评价标准来解释世界艺术，不再是翻译和复述西方学界的艺术研究。透过以中国文明的眼光来看待其他文明的特点，显示其与中国文明之间的异同。从而探讨如何通过对艺术史的探索和研究，建造爱人所爱，敬人所敬，好人所好的世界文化新格局。</p>
<p>

</p><span><p>

    课程的展开将伴随着一个学术任务。2016年，第34届世界艺术史大会即将在中国筹备召开，这是近150年以来首次于西方以外的国家举办的国际级艺术史会议。大会的主题即是本课程所要重点讲述的，不同文化和不同时代中艺术的表现与艺术史的建构。而本课的教员亦将担任会议的学术主席。</p><p>

</p><p>

    本课主要依据三份资料。其一是中央电视台已经完成的大型纪录片《当卢浮宫遇见紫禁城》；其二是《詹森艺术史（第七版）》在中国的翻译出版；其三是《世界艺术史地图》的国内引进与翻译。这三份资料为本课提供了第一手材料及来自西方国家艺术史学科研究中的最新成果。</p></span>

Title:  工程圖學
Short desc:  這是一門實用的入門課程，學習者不需有工程背景。課程目標是培養製圖與讀圖的能力，同時著重理論與實務。理論方面，將教授投影、讀圖、剖面、透視、標註等基本的製圖原理，和各項工程常用的圖像語言。實作方面，將以簡單的案例，循序教授電腦輔助繪圖(CAD)的技巧。課程將設計學習小組以及實作，透過網路上的同儕互動，達到群體學習的功效。總共課程有七週，每週課程安排都包含繪圖理論觀念(4~5個講述影片)，以及電腦繪圖技巧(4~5示範影片)。為了確保學習成效，第1~4週每週都有一個簡單的練習作業，5, 6週為期末專題。每個作業大概一個小時可以完成。
Long desc:  <p>你上次畫圖是什麼時候？畫圖老師是誰？</p>

<p>我想很多人最後一次學畫圖，都是在小學三年級吧！</p>

<p>在資訊時代裡，各類圖說無所不在，幫助我們理解資訊。例如空間資訊，沒有圖，幾乎很難的表達清楚。但雖然圖像已是語言以外最重要的傳遞訊息的方式，多數人似乎缺乏足夠的圖學訓練，因應這個充斥圖像的世界。</p>

<p>本課程是工程圖學的最基礎課程，工程圖學是工程師的基礎語言，可將工程師的想像，實現於真實世界裡。本課程結合理論與實務，讓學生不只知道怎麼做，更要知道為什麼這樣做，或為什麼不那樣做。</p>

<p>在理論方面，將以互動教學的方式，教授投影、讀圖、剖面、透視、標註等基本的製圖原理。課程上會利用大量的圖說、動畫、影片等內容以輔助學習，並且會強調許多人常犯的繪圖錯誤。</p>

<p>實作方面，將以案例的方式，教授電腦輔助繪圖(CAD)。修課者可以在學習互動中，培養工程圖的理解與繪製的技術。前面四週是著重於基礎的指令，以及軟體操作的細節，後面三週則是以案例和評論的方式，教授實用繪圖的技巧。</p>

<p>這個線上課程採用我在臺灣大學土木系授課多年之教材，以較簡化且清晰的方式說明，且輔以許多電腦動畫展示，希望能讓更多人了解工程圖學的概念，並使用在日常生活上。</p>

<p>這門課有趣又實用，歡迎你加入我們的學習之旅！</p>

Title:  Introduction to Computing 计算概论A
Short desc:      计算概论A是针对“信息科学技术学科一年级本科生”开设的一门专业基础主干课程。本课程的教学目标有二：其一，帮助学习者建立起“学习计算机科学技术知识所需的基本知识背景”；其二，帮助学习者“掌握计算机程序设计的基础知识”，培养学习者“独立设计计算机程序解决问题”的基本技能。
Long desc:  <p>课程介绍视频可以访问<a href="http://video.study.163.com/edu-video/nos/mp4/2013/11/20/303418_sd.mp4" target="_blank">这里</a>。</p>
<p><b></b>    本课程的<b>内容</b>主要<b>分为两个部分</b>：（1）<b>计算机基础知识</b>，约占课时量的<b>15%</b>；（2）<b>C程序设计基础</b>，约占课时量的<b>85%</b>；</p>
<p>    在计算机基础知识部分，我们将为大家<b>解答一些与计算机程序设计相关的基础问题</b>，例如<b>，“计算机为什么能够进行计算？”，“计算机程序在计算机中是如何运行的？”，“计算机的发展规律是什么？”，“下一代的计算机将会是什么样子？”</b>等等。我们希望通过对这些问题的解答，达到两个目的：A 培养起大家对计算机科学的兴趣；B 帮助大家建立起学习计算机科学所需要的“背景知识框架”。</p>
<p>    在C程序设计基础部分，我们将<b>以“C 语言”为主要学习对象，以典型的C++编程环境（如Visual Studio C++, Eclipse等）为工具，学习计算机程序设计的相关知识</b>，并培养程序设计的基本技能。通俗讲，在这个部分，我们将教会大家“如何使用C语言编写计算机程序，甚至编写具有一定技术难度的程序”。</p>
<p>    对于第一次学习计算机程序设计的同学而言，通常会觉得学习过程比较困难。在这里，我们特别提示大家：“对于难学的东西，更要循序渐进，更要遵循学习规律——先打好基础，逐步进阶！”为此，<b>我们把“程序设计基础”部分的学习划分为四个迭代周期</b>：</p>
<p><b>        周期一</b>： 感性认识计算机程序；
    <br><b>        周期二</b>： 理性认识程序设计语言； 
    <br><b>        周期三</b>： 学会使用——函数；
    <br><b>        周期四</b>： 学习使用C程序中的复杂成分（指针、结构体、链表、文件等）；</p>
<p>    之所以称为“迭代周期”，是因为<b>我们希望在每个周期中，同学们都能够编写出完整、可运行、能解决问题的计算机程序，而不是仅仅学习计算机程序设计语言的某个部分！</b>所以，学习程序设计的过程，应该是一个<b>“在实战中进阶”的过程，而不是一个“知识堆砌”的过程</b>。希望这个迭代进阶的学习过程可以帮助大家顺利达成学习目标。</p><p>该课程是“北大-德稻网络公开课程”中的一门，由北京大学与德稻教育联合提供。

Title:  The Power of Markets
Short desc:  The course will give you the tools with which to understand and predict market phenomena. A large dose of real-world applications will be provided along the way. These applications illustrate the power and relevance of underlying microeconomic theory while providing you a valuable opportunity to put the theory into practice.
Long desc:  The Power of Markets is designed to arm you with the fundamental tools of microeconomic analysis and to show how the tools can be used to explain and predict the behavior of individuals, organizations, and markets. We will cover the basic principles of microeconomics in a clear and through way, using numerous applications to illustrate the use of theory and to reinforce your understanding of it.<br><br>Microeconomics is the most important course in any undergraduate economics curriculum. Understanding microeconomics also provides an essential foundation to any bachelor’s or master’s degree business student. As a result, this course is designed so that both economics and business students will learn microeconomic theory and how to use it effectively. The course, of course, is beneficial to even a broader demographic that includes high school students to professionals drawn from fields such as finance, entrepreneurship, marketing, consulting, pricing, health care, public policy, education, and law. Indeed, the course is of relevance to all who seek a better understanding of the way in which markets affect our lives and livelihoods. <br><br><br>

Title:  History and Future of (Mostly) Higher Education
Short desc:  In this course we will learn about the features of higher education that were designed specifically to prepare workers and leaders for the Industrial Age, and we’ll strategize ways that, together, we can change learning--inside of school and out--for the world we live in now--and even to help improve our world. #FutureEd
Long desc:  <p></p><p>Welcome!  This course is designed for anyone concerned with the best ways of learning and thriving in the world we live in now.  It's for students, teachers, professors, researchers, administrators, policy makers, business leaders, job counselors and recruiters, parents, and lifelong learners around the globe.  The full,  whimsical name of the class is: “The History and Future of (Mostly) Higher Education: Or, How We Can Unlearn Our Old Patterns and Relearn for a Happier, More Productive, Ethical, and Socially-Engaged Future.”  That subtitle is inspired by Nobel Prize-winning economist Amartya Sen who has said that "all education is vocational" in the sense that it is our job, as educators, to help train people for the vocation of leading better lives.  <br></p><p>Are we fulfilling that educational objective, from kindergarten to professional school?  Or are we training students with the methods, philosophy, and metrics designed for the Fordist era of the Model T?  Since 1993, when scientists made the Internet widely available, our lives, our work, our occupations, our culture, and our entertainments have changed tremendously.  Far too little has changed inside our educational institutions, in the US and internationally, to prepare us for the demands, problems, restrictions, obstacles,  responsibilities, and possibilities of living in the world we inhabit outside of school.  This course addresses one key question:  How can we all, together, work to redesign higher education for our future... not for someone else’s past? </p><p><b><i>Bonus: </i></b><i>Students enrolled in this Coursera course will also be invited to many onsite and online events, workshops, and conferences offered by more than fifty learning institutions around the world, as part of an initiative on <a target="_blank" href="http://www.hastac.org/collections/history-and-future-higher-education">Shaping the Future of Higher Education</a>.</i><i></i></p><br>

<p dir="ltr">Learning mathematics at university is fundamentally different than learning mathematics at high school. This difference has many manifestations: at high school most of the
learning focuses on the development of technical skills, and the tendency is to
draw a clear separation between the various areas of mathematics. In contrast,
the mathematics taught at university level deals to a large extent with
mathematical structures and their interconnections.</p>

<p dir="ltr">This course is a "display
window" of the mathematics that is being taught and studied at the
university. Its main goal is to prepare would-be-students toward the mathematics
that they will encounter, whether they choose to learn this subject, or any
discipline that uses mathematics as its main language and tool (e.g., physics,
computer science, and engineering).</p>

<p dir="ltr">Most of the mathematical content
covered in this course is part of the high school curriculum. The difference is
in the approach. In these lectures we will emphasize central mathematical
concepts (e.g. the need to define ambiguous terms, and the principle
of mathematical deduction). In particular, we will distinguish between
deduction based on intuitive arguments and deduction based on rigorous
reasoning. Moreover, we will demonstrate how seemingly distinct subjects merge
to form the depth and beauty that are at the heart of the mathematical science.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><blockquote><p></p></blockquote>

<p dir="ltr">Learning mathematics at university is fundamentally different than learning mathematics at high school. This difference has many manifestations: at high school most of the
learning focuses on the development of technical skills, and the tendency is to
draw a clear separation between the various areas of mathematics. In contrast,
the mathematics taught at university level deals to a large extent with
mathematical structures and their interconnections.</p>

<p dir="ltr">This course is a "display
window" of the mathematics that is being taught and studied at the
university. Its main goal is to prepare would-be-students toward the mathematics
that they will encounter, whether they choose to learn this subject, or any
discipline that uses mathematics as its main language and tool (e.g., physics,
computer science, and engineering).</p>

<p dir="ltr">Most of the mathematical content
covered in this course is part of the high school curriculum. The difference is
in the approach. In these lectures we will emphasize central mathematical
concepts (e.g. the need to define ambiguous terms, and the principle
of mathematical deduction). In particular, we will distinguish between
deduction based on intuitive arguments and deduction based on rigorous
reasoning. Moreover, we will demonstrate how seemingly distinct subjects merge
to form the depth and beauty that are at the heart of the mathematical science.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><blockquote><p></p></blockquote>

Title:  Imagining Other Earths
Short desc:  Are we alone? This course introduces core concepts in astronomy, biology, and planetary science that  enable the student to speculate scientifically about this profound question and invent their own solar systems. 
Long desc:  Over the past two decades, astronomers have discovered over a thousand planets around nearby stars.  Based on our current knowledge, it seems likely that there are millions of stars in the Galaxy that host Earth-sized planets in Earth-like orbits. What is the range of conditions for these planets to host life? In this course, students will engage with a wide range of concepts in astronomy, biology, chemistry, geology and physics with a focus on developing the background they will use need to think further about this profound question. We will explore the origin and evolution of  life on Earth, particularly in extreme environments, the properties of planets and moons in our Solar System,  the properties of stars and the newly discovered extrasolar planets.<br><br>Course assignments include two short papers describing proposed space missions to study nearby planets and to search for extrasolar planets and a final paper. In the final paper, students will have an opportunity to invent their own planetary system and describe it in terms of either the astronomy of how it was discovered, the properties of their planet and its host star, or the biology of life in the system. Papers will be circulated and evaluated by fellow students as part of the learning experience in the course; this will provide opportunities to develop students' abilities to think like a scientist by applying principles of scientific thinking, to learn new ideas from other students, and to creatively make new connections across different sciences and parts of the course.<br>

Title:  History of the Slave South
Short desc:  This course explores the relationship between slavery and democracy at the heart of American history.  It is about the rise and fall of the slave South from the beginning of the seventeenth century to the end of the American Civil War.
Long desc:  <p>Within the United States, the pre-Civil
War South was a distinct region of plantations, enslaved labor, and
agricultural production for the export market. It was always part of a global
economy, tied into networks of capital, labor, and commodity markets that
spanned continents. The wealth of the slave South was absolutely central to the
political and economic growth of the U.S. and its emergence as a continental
empire in the nineteenth century, but ultimately that system had to be
destroyed for the country to claim its place as a world power.<br>
<br>
Why that was – why the U.S. experienced a brutal Civil War in the 1860s – is a
matter of considerable contention among scholars and a central theme of the
course. The history of the South is a crucial part of the story of the rise of
the U.S. as a global power and it is particularly compelling because of its
history as a slaveholding society, the wealthiest in the western world in 1860.
This course is about the ethical and political questions that history
necessarily poses about the relationship between slavery, capitalism, and
democracy in U.S. and world history.  It is about the rise and fall
of the slave South from the beginning of the seventeenth century to the end of
the American Civil War.<b></b></p>

Title:  Marine Megafauna: An Introduction to Marine Science and Conservation
Short desc:  An introduction to the basics of marine science and conservation, brought to you with the help of sea turtles, marine mammals, seabirds and many more of the most compelling creatures in the ocean.

Long desc:  <b>This course is about sea turtles, whales, dolphins, seals, penguins, sharks, giant squid and other large ocean creatures - </b><i><b>collectively known as marine megafauna</b></i><b> - and what they can tell us about how the ocean works and why it is so important
for all life on earth.
</b><br>
<br>This course will help you learn about life in the ocean, how ocean ecosystems function, how scientists study the ocean, and the challenges we face in sustaining healthy oceans for the future. These topics will be explored using case studies that focus
on charismatic marine megafauna species – the most compelling creatures in the ocean that capture our attention and inspire us to learn more.
<br>
<br>The course starts with an examination of the physical dimensions of the world’s ocean and how we describe ocean zones based on the ecosystems found within them. Once these basics are covered, we will work through the evolution of life in the oceans and
explore how marine animals have adapted to the challenges of a cold, dark and deep ocean. Throughout the class we will highlight how scientists study the oceans and the animals that live in them, providing glimpses of new technologies that boost our understanding
of marine ecology. The course will also cover some of the challenges the oceans face due to human activities - exploring issues such as bycatch and climate change - and how they are affecting ocean species and systems.

This means you will have to learn how to read scientific papers and extract the important bits of information from them. The articles you’ll be reading are all part of a new PLOS Collection focused on using open access research to teach marine science and conservation. You will also get to look at real datasets produced by scientists studying marine creatures and visualize them in freely available programs such as Google Earth.<br></p></span>

Title:  Technology and Ethics
Short desc:  The meteoric rise of technologies used in our everyday life for profit, power, or improvement of an individual's life can, on occasion, cause cultural stress as well as ethical challenges.  In this course, we will explore how these multifaceted impacts might be understood, controlled and mitigated.
Long desc:  <div>When everyone begins pursuing their rights to life, liberty and pursuit of happiness we are bound to step on each other’s toes.  This begs the need for regulations.  And this leads to the question as to “what is moral behavior”; and what are
    the ethics that emanate from the selected definitions of moral behavior. There is no dearth of defined moral behavior created by religions and their leaders, business persons, politicians, philosophers, and in some cases “the everyday person on the
    street”.
    <br>
    <br>
</div>
<div>Example technologies at play today include nuclear energy; biological manipulations for warfare; robots for taking care of the elderly, and enhancing human capability; the use of technology for surveillance; the cultural changing power of the media which
    can create unlimited arrays of images real and virtual to support a point of view; and the internet with its world wide connectivity.
    <br>
    <br>We need to look into social/technology assessment, the transfer of the technology as it is placed into practice, and the techniques/processes that are available for control within the legal, political, institutional and attitudinal environment within
    which the technology is placed as a way of protecting our rights to life, liberty and pursuit of happiness.

Title:  Beauty, Form & Function: An Exploration of Symmetry
Short desc:  Students will learn how to identify symmetrical forms and appreciate their importance in nature, art, architecture, crystallography and technology. By completing this course you will understand symmetry quantitatively, recognize its role in beauty and design and appreciate its function in our everyday life. Workload Breakdown: 4-6 hrs/week for Normal Track; 7-10 hrs/week for Signature Track.
Long desc:  <p>




<span>Symmetry is everywhere. In the
grand scheme of things it is the blueprint by which the universe
operates. We see symmetry in nature, art, architecture, science and
engineering. This course explores the <i>Beauty, Form and Function of Symmetry</i>
in common objects, then progresses to investigate tiling and tessellation, gems
and crystals, and finally its indispensable role in technology. </span></p><p>Walk through an urban or rural landscape and you are immersed in an endless variety of forms, often taken for granted, because our minds have evolved to perceive symmetry in our surroundings so as to accelerate the flight or fight response. Symmetry and asymmetry are also key factors that ensure the successful reproduction of plants and animals. For example, the bilateral symmetry of orchids is widely admired and this geometry is essential for insects to successfully pollinate these flowers.</p><p>This course will give you the means to address several
fundamental questions.  </p><p></p><ul><li>What tags do we recognize in decorative
arrangements? <br></li><li>What guidelines shape the patterns in the world around us? <br></li><li>What
functions do these symmetrical patterns serve? <br></li></ul><p></p><p>From looking at minerals and crystallography and also observing patterns and forms at the atomic scale, important in drug
design, materials synthesis, and data storage devices, students will appreciate how today's advancement in technology, is in no small part a
consequence of humankind’s increasingly sophisticated and precise manipulation
of symmetry.</p><p>To amplify these ideas, you will undertake field-exercises and be
introduced to specialists – botanists, artists, geomancers, historians,
scientists and engineers - that work with symmetry, and who will provide their
personal insights into its ‘magic’ and impact on their disciplines.</p><p>At the conclusion of this study, you
will possess the tools and the motivation to look at symmetry with even greater
delight, wonder and appreciation!</p><p><br><strong>Important note: </strong>The course will be launched on 17 Feb 2014. Registration with Coursera for the Signature Track is now open and the closing date is 28 Feb 2014. It is highly encouraged that you enrol soon, as the 1st assessment will commence from 24th Feb 2014 to 3rd Mar 2014.<br><br></p><p>

Title:  Neuroethics
Short desc:  This course will examine the ethical, legal and social issues raised by neuroscience. Topics will include the implications of new knowledge of the brain for our understanding of selfhood, for the meaning of privacy, for the distinction between therapy and enhancement, and for national security.
Long desc:  “Perhaps a man really dies when his brain stops, when he loses the power to take in a new idea.” --George Orwell<br><br> Neuroethics might well be the most rapidly growing area within bioethics; indeed, in some respects neuroethics has grown as an independent field, with its own journals, professional society and institutional centers. This growth over the past decade is partly attributable to the growth of neuroscience itself and to the challenging philosophical and moral questions it inherently raises. A 2012 Royal Society report observes that “(a)n increasingly mechanistic understanding of the brain raises a host of ethical, legal, and social implications. This has laid the foundation for the emergent field of Neuroethics, which examines ethical issues governing the conceptual and practical developments of neuroscience. Irrespective of their validity, even the claims that modern neuroscience entails the re-examination of complex and sensitive topics like free will, consciousness, identity, and responsibility raises significant ethical issues. As such, neuroethics asks questions that extend beyond the usual umbrella of biomedical ethics.” This course will, therefore, consider the new knowledge and ways of learning about the brain from scientific and ethico-legal and social standpoints. We will examine the core themes of neuroethics, including cognitive enhancement, the nature of the self and personhood, neuroimaging and privacy, and the ways that all these themes are brought together in matters affecting national security.<br><br> <strong><br></strong>

Title:  Understanding Europe: Why It Matters and What It Can Offer You
Short desc:  Learn about the European Union, how it works, why it matters and what it can offer you. Regardless of where you live, the EU not only affects your life but may also transform it. This course aims at empowering you, your family, business and community in Europe and beyond and will enable you to discover jobs you were not aware of. Des sous-titres seront proposés en français.
Long desc:  <p>Regardless of where you live, the European Union has a large, yet often unnoticed, impact on many aspects of your everyday life. Whether you are traveling, eating, working, doing business, shopping, surfing the Internet or breathing, all these activities are largely shaped by the EU.  As a result no global citizen, business leader, lawmaker, lobbyist or student can effectively operate in Europe or in the world without a solid understanding of this unique laboratory of integration. While the EU is often depicted as a monstrous bureaucratic creature, condemned to irrelevance by the emerging economies, it remains the most accomplished experiment of economic, social and political integration in human history. In 50 years the EU accomplished what other countries took centuries to realize.</p><p>Given its inherent complexities, <b>Understanding Europe</b> aims at popularizing the intricacies of the European Union system to <i>promote greater awareness of the opportunities it offers you</i>. Ultimately, you will not only better grasp the applicable framework for any European economic or social activity you engage in, but <i>you will also participate on the EU stage</i>. By confronting you with several current EU policy proposals, you will be able to ‘have a say’ in the EU policymaking process. We want to empower you as a citizen and business operator to maximize your rights and opportunities in today’s Europe.</p><p><b>Understanding Europe</b> is structured upon some basic yet critical questions about the EU’s purpose and legitimacy : why does the EU exist? How does it work? What can it offer you? The course then analyzes the European public sphere by focusing on its main actors (the European Parliament, the Commission, the Council, the Court of Justice of the EU) and the role European citizens play in influencing Europe. We then move to the Union’s powers (what can the EU do? How far can it go? Do Members States have some instruments to “block” EU action? Can EU citizens challenge EU action?) by discussing the limits to its action and describing some of its policies. The course then analyzes the role and opportunities citizens and all stakeholders may have in shaping EU policies through public consultation, the European Citizens Initiative and other forms of participatory democracy. In a further step, we will analyze what the EU is doing for you regardless of where you are based in the world. Finally, by taking stock of what you have learned in the previous weeks, we will look at what you can do for and in Europe.<br></p><p>Throughout the whole course, participants will be confronted with real-life examples of EU action. EU affairs professionals will share their personal EU experiences and tell us about their EU jobs. You can interact with the instructor and other participants, share your opinions, question the instructor’s assumptions and hence shape the course’s content. </p>

Title:  紅樓夢(The Red Chamber Dream)
Short desc:  這門課是對中國小說經典《紅樓夢》的分析與詮釋，著重於認識讀者本身與經典間的關係，並從作者的時代背景與社會階層著手，重新剖析這部人所共愛、人各有所擁戴的經典之作。

Long desc:  作為中國文學中最偉大的小說作品之一，《紅樓夢》在這數百年的流傳中，衍伸出無數精彩的對話與論戰。<br><br>有一千個讀者，就有一千部《紅樓夢》。讀者在閱讀歷程中，與書中人物一同喜怒，悲其所悲，愛其所愛，曹雪芹筆下各形各色的人物，也就此在現代社會中活色生香。<br><br>然而，因為書中角色無法為自己辯駁，讀者在抒發個人體悟的同時，常因對創作中所持有的價值觀與時代背景、風俗習慣不夠熟悉，而使得對人物行為的理解有所失準。誠然，若是只將《紅樓夢》作為一部消遣作品，讀者自然可以隨意揮灑自身的感性。但是，《紅樓夢》不只是一部小說，它同時也不折不扣是一部在文學史上佔有一席之地的偉大經典。一部偉大的經典，要由偉大的讀者成全，而偉大的讀者，只有在閱讀者讓理性超越於感性之上，精準而公正地面對文本時才會誕生。<br><br>賈府的世界奠基於曹雪芹的家世背景之上，一個現代人未加研究便無法理解的貴族階層，其中交錯的人際網路，牽一髮而動全身，一舉一動，俱有規範。未曾置身其中的人，往往容易錯過其中微小的細節，而誤解了人物行為所為的真正目的。<br><br>這門課的目標，將會嘗試解析經典與讀者之間的關係，並由此進入曹雪芹與紅樓夢賈府的世界，一步步剖析往昔時常為人所誤解的種種行為與情思，重新認識這個人所共愛的小說經典。<br><br>《紅樓夢》的世界是如此複雜乖隔，賈寶玉、林黛玉、薛寶釵等人面對的人性是如此深邃多變，這一次細細重讀，或許能讓我們與書中人、與作者曹雪芹的心靈更加貼近，從而發現一個全新的紅樓夢景。<br>

Title:  Case-Based Introduction to Biostatistics
Short desc:  Learn to frame and address health-related questions using modern biostatistics ideas and methods.
Long desc:  The course objective is to enable each student to enhance his or her quantitative
scientific reasoning about problems related to human health. Biostatistics
is about quantitative approaches - ideas and skills - to address bioscience
and health problems. To achieve mastery of biostatistics skills, a student
must “see one, do one, teach one.” Therefore, the course is organized to
promote regular practice of new ideas and methods.
<br>
<br>The course is organized into 3 self-contained modules. Each module
except the first is built around an important health problem.&nbsp;The
first module reviews the scientific method and the role of experimentation
and observation to generate data, or evidence, relevant to selecting among
competing hypotheses about the natural world. Bayes theorem is used to
quantify the concept of evidence. Then, we will discuss what is meant by
the notion of “cause.”
<br>&nbsp;
<br>In the second module, we use a national survey dataset to estimate the
costs of smoking and smoking-caused disease in American society. The concepts
of point and interval estimation are introduced. Students will master the
use of confidence intervals to draw inferences about population means and
differences of means. They will use stratification and weighted averages
to compare subgroups that are otherwise similar in an attempt to estimate
the effects of smoking and smoking-caused diseases on medical expenditures.
<br><span><br>In the final module, we will study what factors influence child-survival in Nepal using data from the Nepal Nutritional Intervention Study Sarlahi or NNIPPS. Students will estimate and obtain confidence intervals for infant survival rates, relative rates and odds ratios within strata defined by gestational period, singleton vs twin births, and parental characteristics. </span>

Title:  Community Change in Public Health
Short desc:  This course examines the community context of the changes needed to promote the public’s health.
Long desc:  <div>In bringing about behavior change in public health, we often focus on
    the individual mother, student, or farmer. We should not forget the community
    structure and norms constrain for encouraging individual health behaviors.
    This course examines the community context of the changes needed to promote
    the public’s health. We begin by examining the various definitions of ‘community’
    and the processes by which we ‘diagnose’ or seek to understand the structure
    and characteristics of different types of communities. An appreciation
    of community similarities and differences is necessary lest we fall into
    the trap of designing one-size-fits-all interventions. We need to recognize
    that no matter that outsiders may view a community as poor or neglected,
    we can find strengths and capacities for improvement in each community.
    Identifying community capacities and resources is the first step in facilitating
    community change. Different practical and philosophical approaches to change
    and therefore, examined. Specific to the change process is our recognition
    of the need for communities to participate in the design, implementation
    and evaluation of any intervention. We examine the concept of participation
    in an effort to see how different levels of involvement may affect sustainability
    of community change efforts. Finally a case study of a community participatory
    approach to onchocerciasis control in Africa is presented. Community Directed
    Intervention has subsequently been successfully applied to providing other
    essential primary health care services by and in the community, such as
    insecticide treated bednets, malaria treatment, vitamin A distribution,
    deworming medicines, and pneumonia and diarrhea case management.

Title:  Social and Economic Networks:  Models and Analysis
Short desc:  Learn how to model social and economic networks and their impact on human behavior.  How do networks form, why do they exhibit certain patterns, and how does their structure impact diffusion, learning, and other behaviors?   We will bring together models and techniques from economics, sociology, math, physics, statistics and computer science to answer these questions.  
Long desc:  <div>Social networks pervade our social and economic lives.   They play a central role in the transmission of information about job opportunities and are critical to the trade of many goods and services. They are important in determining which products we buy, which languages we speak, how we vote, as well as whether or not we decide to become criminals, how much education we obtain, and our likelihood of succeeding professionally.   The countless ways in which network structures affect our well-being make it critical to understand how social network structures impact behavior, which network structures are likely to emerge in a society, and why we organize ourselves as we do.  This course provides an overview and synthesis of research on social and economic networks, drawing on studies by sociologists, economists, computer scientists, physicists, and mathematicians.</div><div><br></div><div>The course begins with some empirical background on social and economic networks, and an overview of concepts used to describe and measure networks.   Next, we will cover a set of models of how networks form, including random network models as well as strategic formation models, and some hybrids.   We will then discuss a series of models of how networks impact behavior, including contagion, diffusion, learning, and peer influences.</div><div><br></div>

Title:  Image and video processing: From Mars to Hollywood with a stop at the hospital
Short desc:  In this class you will look behind the scenes of image and video processing, from the basic and classical tools to the most modern and advanced algorithms.
Long desc:  What is image and video processing? Images and videos are everywhere, from those we take with our mobile devices and share with our friends to those that we receive from Mars and the ones we see in the movie theatre, without forgetting the whole ensemble of images of our bodies that are taken in hospital visits. Image and video processing is the art of working with such images and movies, from making it possible to store and transmit them to making those dark and blurry images look nice, as well as interpreting and analyzing the medical data and recognizing our friends’ faces in social pictures. This discipline is also fascinating because it uses tools from many areas of applied mathematics. In this class you will look behind the scenes of image and video processing, from the basic and classical tools to the most modern and advanced algorithms.<br><br> The course will start with an introduction to the basics of image formation and the fundamental concepts that translate a physical scene into a digital image. We will then describe the underlying concepts of image compression, the enabling technology that makes it possible for images to be sent from Mars and videos to be stored in our mobile phones. We will cover the most fundamental tools in image enhancement, showing how simple tools can significantly improve images. Both geometric and non-geometric tools as well as spatial and non-spatial operations will be presented. Details on image segmentation will be provided, one of the most fundamental and useful problems in image processing. The above topics will be extended to color images and video. Once we have covered the fundamentals, which both provide the basis for modern image and video processing and serve many important applications until today, we will move into recent progress in the area, covering image inpainting (how to remove objects from images and video), image processing via sparse modeling and compressed sensing, geometric partial differential equations for image analysis, image processing for HIV and virus research, and image processing for neurosurgery and other medical applications.

Title:  Les problèmes métaphysiques à l’épreuve de la politique, 1943-1968
Short desc:  L'objet de ce cours est d'étudier l'articulation entre les prises de position et les théories politiques des philosophes français du XXème siècle et leur philosophie fondamentale, voire leur métaphysique. Le parcours proposé sollicite l'étude de textes entre autres de Sartre, Merleau-Ponty, Cavaillès, Weil, Levi-Strauss, Althusser, Foucault, Deleuze, Lévinas, Derrida...

Long desc:  <span>La
philosophie française contemporaine ne se laisse pas penser indépendamment de
l’engagement politique de philosophes (Sartre, Merleau-Ponty, Camus, Althusser,
Levi-Strauss, Foucault, Deleuze, Derrida, Levinas, parmi d’autres)  qui en ont écrit l’histoire. La guerre et la
paix, le communisme et la décolonisation, la violence et le pouvoir sont autant
de questions, dont l’analyse et la discussion n’ont jamais cessé de ponctuer
leur travail. Mais si ces prises de position « politiques » doivent
être également tenues pour « philosophiques », c’est parce qu’elles  sont indissociables  du travail proprement théorique, et des
problèmes métaphysiques qu’elles impliquent, 
tels qu’ils sont traités dans les œuvres majeures  de ces philosophes, et dans les débats qui
les ont opposés, dessinant les moments centraux du siècle, trop vite figés dans
« l’existentialisme » ou le « structuralisme ». Le parti
pris de ce cours est donc de revenir, au-delà des clichés qui les masquent, et
en les éclairant l’un par l’autre, à l’articulation de ces « engagements
politiques » et de ces « problèmes métaphysiques ».</span>

Title:  Bioinformatic Methods II
Short desc:  Use of available (mainly web-based) programs for analyzing biological data. This is Part 2 of an introductory course with a strong emphasis on hands-on methods. Some theory is introduced, but the main focus is on using extant bioinformatics tools to analyze data and generate biological hypotheses.
Long desc:  <i></i>Large-scale biology projects such as the sequencing of the human genome and gene expression surveys using RNA-seq, microarrays and other technologies have created a wealth of data for biologists. However, the challenge facing scientists is analyzing
and even accessing these data to extract useful information pertaining to the system being studied. This course focuses on employing existing bioinformatic resources – mainly web-based programs and databases – to access the wealth of data to answer questions
relevant to the average biologist, and is highly hands-on.
<br>
<br>Topics covered include multiple sequence alignments, phylogenetics, gene expression data analysis, and protein interaction networks, in two separate parts.
<br>
<br>The first part, <b>Bioinformatic Methods I</b>, dealt with databases, Blast, multiple sequence alignments, phylogenetics, selection analysis and metagenomics.
<br>
<br>This, the second part, <b>Bioinformatic Methods II</b>, will cover motif searching, protein-protein interactions, structural bioinformatics, gene expression data analysis, and cis-element predictions.
<br>
<br>This pair of courses is useful to any student considering graduate school in the biological sciences, as well as students considering molecular medicine.

Title:  Vaccine Trials: Methods and Best Practices
Short desc:  This course will explore the process of evaluating investigational vaccines in clinical trials including informed consent, recruitment, enrollment, safety evaluation, and quality data collection.
Long desc:  <div>Vaccines are evaluated through a series of clearly defined controlled
    studies to assess these investigational products for safety, immunogenicity
    and efficacy before they are approved for licensure. &nbsp;All clinical
    vaccine trials are bound by international ethical guidelines and, in the
    case of US trials, Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulations.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Good Clinical Practice is defined by the International Conferences on
    Harmonization (ICH) as: “A standard for the design, conduct, performance,
    monitoring, auditing, recording, analysis, and reporting of clinical trials
    that provides assurance that the data and reported results are credible
    and accurate, and that the rights, integrity and confidentiality of trial
    subjects are protected.”</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>That’s a tall order, so how is it done? &nbsp;Individuals who enroll as
    subjects in these trials play an essential role in the development and
    evaluation of new and improved candidate vaccines. &nbsp;They are average
    citizens who volunteer to roll up their sleeves and, in the process, make
    a tremendous difference in society. &nbsp;So why do they volunteer and
    what safeguards do we put in place to protect their rights, safety and
    well-being while in the trial? &nbsp;What are the responsibilities of the
    investigators, sponsors and ethics committees who conduct and oversee these
    trials?&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Along with our colleagues, we will introduce you to how GCP is applied
    in clinical vaccine trials to ensure proper and ethical scientific conduct.
    The course will use examples from real vaccine trials to demonstrate the
    application of the FDA Code of Federal Regulations and ICH GCP Guidelines
    to explore methods and best practices involved in implementing phase I
    and II vaccine clinical trials. &nbsp;This short course offering through
    Coursera is based on our work at the Center for Immunization Research and
    an in-depth graduate course taught at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School
    of Public Health.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>We hope it inspires you to work in this exciting field.</div>

Title:  Statistical Mechanics: Algorithms and Computations
Short desc:  In this course you will learn a whole lot of modern physics (classical and quantum) from basic computer programs that you will download, generalize, or write from scratch, discuss, and then hand in. Join in if you are curious (but not necessarily knowledgeable) about algorithms, and about the deep insights into science that you can obtain by the algorithmic approach.
Long desc:  <div>This
 course discusses the computational approach in modern physics in a 
clear yet accessible way. Individual modules contain in-depth 
discussions of algorithms ranging from basic enumeration methods to cutting-edge Markov-chain techniques. Emphasis will be put on 
applications in classical and quantum physics. The focus
 will be on subjects such as Monte Carlo sampling, molecular 
dynamics, transition phases in hard-sphere liquids, simulated annealing 
for solving geometrical constraints, perfect sampling of classical spin 
models, to aspects of quantum Monte Carlo algorithms, Bose-Einstein 
condensation, and many-body physics with fermions. <span>The emphasis is on orientation. Discussion of implementation details will be kept to a minimum.</span></div>
<p>
The course is entirely
self-contained. It heavily relies on concise algorithms  (each
with between 10 and  50 lines of Python code). Modules lead from
elementary discussions to the rich and difficult problems in
contemporary physics, and are of interest to a wide range of students
in the natural sciences.</p><br>

Title:  On Strategy : What Managers Can Learn from Great Philosophers
Short desc:  In the expression “creative thinking”, the keyword is not creativity; the keyword is thinking. With the help of great philosophers, you will rediscover the art of thinking.
Long desc:  The
			business world is at first sight a world of numbers. Accounting,
			algorithms, processes, quarterly figures, market shares, stock
			options, currency exchange rates etc. In all those areas, strong
			management tools exist and allow leaders to track their
			activities, improve their strategy, and overall run their company.<span><span><span>
			<p>But
			another part the business world, equally important, has no numbers
			available. Corporate image, stress, creativity, team spirit,
			assertiveness, "black swans", aesthetics etc. 
			</p>
			<p>And
			a lack of rigor suddenly occurs with the excuse : "Since I
			can't measure, I can't manage... "</p>
			<p>This
			is a mistake. The success of a business depends on its capacity to
			make a difference regarding competition. And today's differences
			in the eyes of a customer are probably built more on perception
			than on reality. 
			</p>
			<p>To
			help leaders to be rigorous even without figures, great
			philosophers have lots of ideas. Managers are invited to
			rediscover the art of thinking. They should understand the role of
			mental models, realize the importance of cognitive bias, agree on
			clear definitions and efficient criteria etc.</p>
			<p>When
			one says, for example, "We should think creatively about the
			future of the company," our minds immediately focus on the word
			"company," which is part of the daily life. But it is
			important to split the sentence into 4 pieces and to pay some
			attention to three other key words namely "think",
			"creatively" and "future". They all must be
			considered as separated topics.</p>
			<p>Creativity
			demands the ability to unshackle ourselves from conventional ways
			of thinking, to "think outside the box". But we need to
			go a step further. Once outside the box, we need to construct a
			new box or boxes (that is, new intellectual frameworks or models)
			to help us structure our thinking. Only once we have done so can
			we generate truly game-changing ideas.</p>

Title:  Gamification
Short desc:  Gamification is the application of game elements and digital game design techniques to non-game problems, such as business and social impact challenges. This course will teach you the mechanisms of gamification, why it has such tremendous potential, and how to use it effectively.
Long desc:  <div>Gamification is the application of digital game design techniques to non-game problems, such as business and social impact challenges. Video games are the dominant entertainment form of our time because they are powerful tools for motivating behavior.
    Effective games leverage both psychology and technology, in ways that can be applied outside the immersive environments of games themselves. Gamification as a business practice has exploded over the past two years. Organizations are applying it in
    areas such as marketing, human resources, productivity enhancement, sustainability, training, health and wellness, innovation, and customer engagement. Game thinking means more than just dropping in badges and leaderboards; it requires a thoughtful
    understanding of motivation and design techniques. This course examines the mechanisms of gamification and provides an understanding of its effective use.

Title:  Epigenetic Control of Gene Expression
Short desc:  Each mammalian cell has the same genes, yet performs distinct functions. This is achieved by epigenetic control of gene expression; the switching on and switching off of genes. This course will cover the principles of epigenetic control of gene expression, how epigenetic control contributes to cellular differentiation and development, and how it goes wrong in disease.
Long desc:  <p><b></b>While the human genome sequence has
transformed our understanding of human biology, it isn’t just the sequence of
your DNA that matters, but also how you use it! How are some genes activated
and others are silenced? How is this controlled? The answer is epigenetics.  </p>

<p>Epigenetics has been a hot topic for research
over the past decade as it has become clear that aberrant epigenetic control
contributes to disease (particularly to cancer). Epigenetic alterations are heritable
through cell division, and in some instances are able to behave similarly to
mutations in terms of their stability. Importantly, unlike genetic mutations,
epigenetic modifications are reversible and therefore have the potential to be
manipulated therapeutically. It has also become clear in recent years that
epigenetic modifications are sensitive to the environment (for example diet),
which has sparked a large amount of public debate and research.</p>

<p>This course will give an introduction to the
fundamentals of epigenetic control. We will examine epigenetic phenomena that
are manifestations of epigenetic control in several organisms, with a focus on
mammals. We will examine the interplay between epigenetic control and the
environment and finally the role of aberrant epigenetic control in disease.</p>

Title:  Practical Ethics
Short desc:  Is abortion wrong? Should we eat animals? What is our responsibility to the world’s 
poor? This course will encourage you to examine your ethical beliefs on topics relevant 
to the ancient question posed by Socrates: “How am I to live?”
Long desc:  In this course you will be encouraged to think about some of the ethical issues that we all face in our daily lives, and as concerned, global citizens. The course will focus on the following topics:

<b><br><br>Brain death and persistent vegetative state </b>
<br>When is a person dead? In many countries death is now defined as “brain death,” but is this way of understanding death justified? How we define death is important, because it is connected to critical questions such as: When is organ donation permissible?
When is it right to take someone off life support? And how should we treat individuals who are in a persistent vegetative state?
<br>
<br><b>Abortion and the moral status of embryos and fetus</b> 
<br>Most people would argue that it is always wrong to intentionally take the life of an innocent human being. This belief is often expressed in terms of support for the “sanctity of human life.” Is abortion or embryo research compatible with this idea? Does
an embryo have a right to life from the beginning of conception, or is this right something it acquires gradually? When, if ever, is abortion justified?
<br>
<br><b>Making end of life decisions</b> 
<br>How do you distinguish wrongful killing from acts that are not regarded as wrong? Can it ever be right to end the life of someone who cannot express a view about whether he or she wants to live or die? How should we make life and death decisions for severely
ill infants? And can euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide be justified?
<br>
<br><b>Effective altruism
</b>
<br>We all spend money on items that are not necessities. In other parts of the world, people die for the want of food or medicines that cost a few cents. The common view is that giving to poor people in other countries is charity, something that is good
to do, but not wrong if we don’t. But is that really true? This topic concerns what our responsibility is for people less well of than us, what the best cause is, and what good career choices are. How much we ought to do for others?
<br>
<br><b>Climate change</b> 
<br>On what principles should nations agree on the extent of their emissions of greenhouse gasses? Should the nations that have contributed most to climate change compensate the nations that are suffering, and will suffer, most from it? Or should some other
principle of justice govern the way we allocate quotas for greenhouse gas emissions?
<br>
<br><b>Animals</b> 
<br>It is common to draw a sharp line between how we are allowed to treat human beings and what we are allowed to do to animals. We consider cannibalism abhorrent, but routinely raise and kill animals for food. We set strict guidelines for experimenting on
human beings, but much more lax ones for experimenting on animals. Is this attitude to animals justifiable? One way to put this question is to ask: “Do animals have rights?” But the debate does not have to revolve around animal rights. It can also be
put in terms of the idea of equality, and where it stops—that is, does equality only apply to human beings? This topic concerns how we should treat animals, and when experimentation on animals is justified.
<br>
<br><b>Environmental values</b> 
<br>It is one thing to argue that we can extend ethics beyond the boundary of our own species, to other sentient beings, but it is a quite different thing to hold that there is also intrinsic value in something that cannot feel anything, like plants, or isn’t
even alive, like mountains and streams. Can such a claim be justified? If it cannot, what difference does it make to the case for wilderness protection?
<br>
<br><b>Why act ethically?</b> Many of you might reach the conclusion that the ethical life can be a demanding one. So why bother? Why act ethically, rather than doing whatever you please? This is an ancient question, which some philosophers have dismissed
as illegitimate, and others have sought to answer, in various ways. It leads us to questions about the meaning of life, and what it is to lead a good life.
<br><br>
<p>This course will introduce you to some of the ways philosophers have approached these questions, as well as some of their answers. You will also be encouraged to question your own ethical beliefs, and in the process explore the extent to which reason
and argument can play a role in everyday ethical decision-making.</p>

Title:  Computer Networks
Short desc:  The Internet is a computer network that millions of people use every day. Understand the design strategies used to solve computer networking problems while you learn how the Internet works.
Long desc:  Computer networks from ISPs to WiFi and cellular networks are a key part
of the information economy. These networks are the foundation for the Web,
and they enable companies such as Google, Facebook and Amazon. This course
introduces the fundamental problems of computer networking, from sending
bits over wires to running distributed applications. For each problem,
we explore the design strategies that have proven valuable in practice.
Topics include error detection and correction, multiple-access, bandwidth
allocation, routing, internetworking, reliability, quality of service,
naming, content delivery, and security. As we cover these topics, you will
learn how the internals of the Internet work to support the Web and other
networked applications. You will develop a detailed understanding of widely-used
networking technologies such as TCP/IP, HTTP, 802.11, Ethernet, and DNS.

Title:  Property and Liability: An Introduction to Law and Economics
Short desc:  Think about the oldest and most familiar principles of American law, property and proportional liability, in a new and surprising way, and learn to apply economic reasoning to an especially important and interesting aspect of life. 
Long desc:  One of the most interesting
and important developments in social science since 1970 has been the
"discovery" of a consistent economic logic underlying the great
common law subjects of property, contract, tort and crime, the
thousand-year-old bedrock of the English and American legal systems. Property
and contract provide the institutional
scaffolding that makes free exchange in markets possible, while the liability
systems of tort and crime appear to mimic market exchange in areas of human activity
where free exchange itself, for well-defined reasons, is not possible. This
course seeks to expose this underlying economic logic through the close
investigation of a series of paradigmatic problems and examples in light of
some simple but very powerful economic ideas. The course assumes no prior
background in economics or law, and begins with an introduction to the basic
concepts of property, exchange, efficiency and externality. On this foundation,
specific topics in the law, including property, tort and crime, eminent domain, intellectual property and criminal procedure, are considered. Each group of lectures will
elaborate on a different concrete problem or example to suggest the range of legal issues and questions to which economic reasoning can be productively applied. The ideas and
modes of analysis developed in the course are not difficult or mysterious, but
the questions of interpretation and policy that they raise about a subject that affects everyone are challenging and
provocative. <p></p>

Title:  Logic: Language and Information 1
Short desc:  This is an introduction to formal logic and how it is applied in computer science, electronic engineering, linguistics and philosophy. You will learn propositional logic—its language, interpretations and proofs, and apply it to solve problems in a wide range of disciplines.

Title:  Buddhism and Modern Psychology 
Short desc:  The Buddha said that human suffering—ranging from anxiety to sadness to unfulfilled craving—results from not seeing reality clearly. He described a kind of meditation that promises to ease suffering by dispelling illusions about the world and ourselves. What does psychological science say about this diagnosis and prescription—and about the underlying model of the mind?
Long desc:  <p>The Dalai
Lama has said that Buddhism and science are deeply compatible and has
encouraged Western scholars to critically examine both the meditative practice
and Buddhist ideas about the human mind. A number of scientists and
philosophers have taken up this challenge. There have been brain scans of
meditators and philosophical examinations of Buddhist doctrines. There have
even been discussions of Darwin and the Buddha: Do early Buddhist descriptions
of the mind, and of the human condition, make particular sense in light of
evolutionary psychology? </p>

<p>This course
will examine how Buddhism is faring under this scrutiny. Are neuroscientists
starting to understand how meditation “works”? Would such an understanding

Title:  Buddhism and Modern Psychology 
Short desc:  The Buddha said that human suffering—ranging from anxiety to sadness to unfulfilled craving—results from not seeing reality clearly. He described a kind of meditation that promises to ease suffering by dispelling illusions about the world and ourselves. What does psychological science say about this diagnosis and prescription—and about the underlying model of the mind?
Long desc:  <p>The Dalai
Lama has said that Buddhism and science are deeply compatible and has
encouraged Western scholars to critically examine both the meditative practice
and Buddhist ideas about the human mind. A number of scientists and
philosophers have taken up this challenge. There have been brain scans of
meditators and philosophical examinations of Buddhist doctrines. There have
even been discussions of Darwin and the Buddha: Do early Buddhist descriptions
of the mind, and of the human condition, make particular sense in light of
evolutionary psychology? </p>

<p>This course
will examine how Buddhism is faring under this scrutiny. Are neuroscientists
starting to understand how meditation “works”? Would such an understanding
validate meditation—or might physical explanations of meditation undermine the
spiritual significance attributed to it? And how are some of the basic Buddhist
claims about the human mind holding up? We’ll pay special attention to some
highly counterintuitive doctrines: that the self doesn’t exist, and that much
of perceived reality is in some sense illusory. Do these claims, radical as
they sound, make a certain kind of sense in light of modern psychology? And
what are the implications of all this for how we should live our lives? Can
meditation make us not just happier, but better people?</p>

Title:  Energy 101
Short desc:  As a society and individually, we use energy every moment of our lives to improve our quality of life. Energy 101 will develop the big picture and connect the details of our energy use, technology, infrastructure, impact, and future.
Long desc:  Energy 101 focuses on the big energy picture giving perspective and context to the details one reads in the daily onslaught of energy news in the headlines. As the number 101 indicates, there are no pre-requisites and no particular training or background needed. The course will review the driving forces of energy used in transportation, building heating and cooling, electrical loads and manufacturing. The current facts and trends of the resulting demands placed on coal, oil, natural gas, nuclear, biomass, solar and wind used to meet these energy demands are then covered. The technologies and characteristics of different energy processes and infrastructure used to convert the renewable, fossil, and nuclear energy into the desired form necessary to accomplish a given task are then described. Economics is always a part of the discussion. The natural laws of thermodynamics limiting these processes are described, as well as future technologies and their potential.

Title:  Turn Down the Heat: Why a 4°C Warmer World Must be Avoided
Short desc:  It is now clear that without action on climate change, the world may become 4°C warmer by the end of this century. Such an increase would threaten to roll back decades of development progress; thus, we are at a ‘make it or break it’ point in time. This course presents the most recent scientific evidence, as well as some of the opportunities for urgent action.
Long desc:  Under current pledges and commitments, the world is likely to reach 4°C degree warming by the end of the century and 2°C warming as early as 2040. This MOOC brings together renowned scientists to provide a synthesis of the most recent scientific evidence
and presents an analysis of likely impacts and risks, with a focus on developing countries. It chronicles already observed changes in the climate system and their impacts, through the increase in carbon dioxide emissions, corresponding temperature increases
and melting of glaciers and sea ice, and changes in precipitation patterns. This course also offers projections for the 21st century for droughts, heat waves and sea-level rise, with implications for food and water security, as well as possible impacts
on agriculture, water availability, ecosystems and human health.
<br>
<br>This MOOC presents an analysis of the likely impacts of a 4°C warming trajectory and stresses the need for decision makers and communities to take a serious look at their adaptation choices, while also signaling the urgency for mitigation action. Participants
will also be introduced to the risks of triggering non-linearity, and tipping elements, such as the disintegration of the West Antarctic ice sheet and large-scale Amazon dieback. The course ends with a discussion of the main policy choices needed to prevent
warming above 2°C.

Title:  Microeconomics Principles
Short desc:  Introduction to the functions of individual decision-makers, both consumers and producers, within the larger economic system. Primary emphasis on the nature and functions of product markets, the theory of the firm under varying conditions of competition and monopoly, and the role of government in promoting efficiency in the economy.
Long desc:  <h2>Why 3 Versions?</h2>

<p><b>Note</b>: In January 2014 we will offer 3 versions of this course so
    that you can choose a version that best meets your needs. Two of the versions
    are identical except for the duration of the course. The third version
    is both shorter and covers slightly less material, focusing on just the most critical
    aspects of microeconomics principles. See further below for more details
    about the differences.</p>

<h2>About the Course</h2>

<p>Most people make the incorrect assumption that economics is ONLY the study
    of money.  My primary goal in this course is to shatter this belief.
     In fact, in the last 50 years economists have tackled some of the
    most interesting and important questions for humanity.  For instance,
    the following are just a few examples:</p>
<div>
    <ul>
        <li>About Love and Marriage
            <ul>
                <li>Why is the divorce rate so high and what should we do in order to reduce
                    it?</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>About the Environment
            <ul>
                <li>Why do we have so much pollution?</li>
                <li>How much is an endangered species worth?</li>
            </ul>
        </li>

            <div>About Crime</div>
            <div>
                <ul>
                    <li>Would legalizing marijuana lead to a reduction in crime?</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
        </li>
        <li>
            <div>About Labor Markets</div>
            <div>
                <ul>
                    <li>Does increasing the Federal Minimum Wage put people out of work?</li>
                    <li>Why did so many women enter the labor force during the last 40 years?</li>

        </li>
        <li>
            <div>And about many other things:</div>
            <div>
                <ul>
                    <li>Would school vouchers lead to improvements in public education?</li>
                    <li>Why a draft would only damage the army?</li>
                    <li>How to level the playing field in baseball?</li>
                    <li>AND, why is COURSERA offering this course free of charge?</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
        </li>
    </ul>
</div>
<p>Additional questions we will consider:</p>
<ul>
<li>What economists do and the strange way they think? (Basic Concepts, Modeling and Trade)</li>
<li>What determines prices and quantity
    in a market economy? (Supply and Demand)</li>
<li>What is the relationship between
    free market economies and social welfare? (Market Efficiency and Government
    Intervention)</li>
<li>What are the distributional effects
    of taxes? (Elasticity and Taxes)</li>
<li>What is the relationship between
    production and costs in a firm? (Production and Costs)</li>
<li>How competitive firms choose their
    efficient level of output? (Competitive Output)</li>
<li>What are the pricing policies of
    firms with some degree of market power? (Firms With Market Power)</li>
<li>How much pollution is too much pollution?
    (Public Goods, Common Resources and Externalities)</li>
<p>We will be addressing many of these (and many more) questions
during this course. Again, my main goal will to show you the way economists
think and how to use this analytical system to answer questions related
not only to these and other important human issues but pretty much to anything
you end up doing with your life after this class. After all, as you will
quickly find out, I believe everything is economics!</p></ul>

think and how to use this analytical system to answer questions related
not only to these and other important human issues but pretty much to anything
you end up doing with your life after this class. After all, as you will
quickly find out, I believe everything is economics!</p></ul>

Title:  Электричество и магнетизм. Часть 1 (Electricity and Magnetism. Part 1)
Short desc:  Курс  посвящен изучению базовых законов электростатики и магнитостатики.

Long desc:  <p>Что такое физика и зачем она нужна? Некоторые люди никогда не задаются таким вопросом. Некоторые считают, что физика нужна исключительно для создания приятных «штучек», например холодильников или мобильных телефонов. И они в чем-то правы, ведь сказал же Оскар Уайльд, что «Комфорт – это единственное, что может нам дать цивилизация». Для нас физика – это умение <b>видеть</b> и <b>понимать</b> окружающий мир, возможность творить то, о чем раньше даже и мечтать было сложно. Мы считаем, что для дальнейшего прогресса человечества необходимы ученые-физики, инженеры-физики и просто образованные люди. Мы готовы делиться нашими знаниями. </p><p>Предлагаемый курс «Электричество и магнетизм. Часть 1» посвящен рассмотрению ключевых понятий электростатики и магнитостатики. Он включает в себя обсуждение уравнений Максвелла, записанных в статическом случае как внутри вещества, так и вне его, энергетических подходов для вычисления сил, действующих на объекты, находящиеся электростатическом или магнитном поле, а также рассмотрение свойств для постоянных токов.</p>

Title:  Sports and Society
Short desc:  This course explores the role of sports around the world, and how the games we watch and play shape identity, culture, and society. 
Long desc:  Sports play a giant role in contemporary society worldwide. But
few of us pause to think about the larger questions of money, politics,
race, sex, culture, and commercialization that surround sports everywhere. This course draws on the tools of anthropology, sociology, history,
and other disciplines to give you new perspectives on the games we watch
and play. We will focus on both popular sports like soccer (or “football,”
as anyone outside America calls it), basketball, and baseball, and also
lesser-known ones like mountain-climbing and fishing. Special guests
will include former major league baseball player and ESPN commentator
<a href="http://www.dougglanville.com">Doug Glanville</a>; leading sports journalist <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selena_Roberts">Selena Roberts</a>; best-selling soccer author <a target="_blank" href="http://books.google.com/books/about/The_Ball_is_Round.html?id=_ODMn27ZKG8C">David G</a><a target="_blank" href="http://books.google.com/books/about/The_Ball_is_Round.html?id=_ODMn27ZKG8C">oldblatt</a>; skateboarding expert Dwayne Dixon; and Katya Wesolowski, a specialist in the Afro-Brazilian martial art of capoeira.&nbsp;You will never watch or think
        about sports in the same way again.

Title:  Child Nutrition and Cooking 2.0
Short desc:  Learn the basics of child nutrition and how to make healthy meals for healthy children and families in version 2.0 of the "Just Cook" class.

Long desc:  Eating patterns that begin in childhood affect health and wellbeing across
the lifespan. In the USA, we are in the midst of a childhood obesity epidemic
that threatens to leave our children with a shorter life expectancy than
their parents. As processed foods become more readily available around
the world, other developed nations are beginning to follow suit. This course
examines contemporary child nutrition in America from the individual decisions
made by each family to the widespread food marketing targeting our children.
 The health risks associated with obesity in childhood are also discussed.
Students will learn what constitutes a healthy diet for children and adults
and how to prepare simple, delicious foods aimed at inspiring a lifelong
celebration of easy home-cooked meals. This course will help prepare students
to be the leading health providers, teachers and parents of the present
and future.

Title:  Unethical Decision Making in Organizations
Short desc:  This course 'Unethical decision making in organizations : A seminar on the dark side of the force' will teach you how strong organizational contexts push good people towards unethical decisions. You will also learn how to protect yourself and your organization against such forces lurking in the dark.
Long desc:  Whenever we hear about ethical scandals, we tend to believe that unethical or illegal behavior in organizations is driven by character deficiencies of individual actors. Put differently, we simply assume that bad things are done by bad people (so-called bad apples). However, numerous corporate scandals, such as Enron, Ford, or Siemens, have demonstrated that even people with a high level of integrity can break the rules if they are put into a corrupt context. Good apples may become rotten in bad barrels. Regardless of their good intentions and strong values, individual actors might adapt to the unethical practices in their respective organizational context and, over time, lose the ability to see their wrongdoings. They become ethically blind. Such changes in people’s way of seeing the world and their value systems can occur in—and through—various organizational contexts in business, civil society, and public administration. This course is not about apples but about barrels and barrel makers. A better understanding of why and under what conditions good people make bad ethical decisions will enable us to better protect individuals as well as their respective organizations against the overwhelming power of the context. It will also enable us to cure societies from problems like corruption.<br><br>The goal of this course is to empower students to analyze the risks of unethical or illegal behavior that might be triggered by powerful contexts. It will draw from various disciplines such as management, psychology, sociology, philosophy, and literature, in order to learn what these disciplines contribute to a better understanding of unethical behavior. The course will also analyze some of the most eminent organizational scandals of the recent decades through the lenses of these disciplines.<br>

Title:  Control of Mobile Robots
Short desc:  Learn about how to make mobile robots move in effective, safe, predictable, and collaborative ways using modern control theory.
Long desc:  This course investigates how to make mobile robots move in effective, safe, and predictable ways. The basic tool for achieving this is "control theory", which deals with the question of how dynamical systems, i.e., systems whose behaviors change over time, can be effectively influenced. In the course, these two domains - controls and robotics - will be interleaved and we will go from the basics of control theory, via robotic examples of increasing complexity - all the way to the research frontier. The course will focus on mobile robots as the target application and problems that will be covered include (1) how to make (teams of) wheeled ground robots avoid collisions while reaching target locations, &nbsp;(2) how to make aerial, quadrotor robots follow paths in the presence of severe disturbances, and (3) how to locomotive bipedal, humanoid robots.<br><br>While the main focus of this course is theory, it is important to be able to map the theory onto an actual physical platform. As such, the course&nbsp;will provide detailed instructions on how to build a mobile robot from scratch as an optional part of the course. In addition, an introduction into microcontrollers, mechatronics, and electronics will be given so that, by the end of the course, the controllers developed in the course can run on an actual mobile robot.<br><br>The course will also feature optional programming assignments, which will&nbsp;focus on implementing the controllers developed in this course for a&nbsp;mobile robot. A MATLAB-based simulator will be available run controllers&nbsp;from the programming assignments on a simulated robot or on the mobile&nbsp;robot built in this course. As a result of support from MathWorks, a&nbsp;downloadable license for MATLAB and course recommended toolboxes will be&nbsp;available for the duration of the MOOC.<br>

Title:  Sports and Building Aerodynamics
Short desc:  Have we reached the boundaries of what can be achieved in sports and building design? The answer is definitely “NO”. This course explains basic aspects of bluff body aerodynamics, wind tunnel testing and Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations with application to sports and building aerodynamics. It is intended for anyone with a strong interest in these topics. Key fields addressed are urban physics, wind engineering and sports engineering. 
Long desc:  Can
the present outstanding records in cycling team time trials be
further improved? Can the present world and Olympic records in
athletics disciplines such as the 100 m sprint be advanced? This
course provides the answer to these questions. It shows that
aerodynamic processes in sports and around buildings are very complex
and that many misconceptions exist. These misconceptions are caused
by the often counter-intuitive flow physics. Interestingly, the same
counter-intuitive flow physics govern the misconceptions in both
sports and building aerodynamics. The insights from this course will
help you to understand and improve the performance of top athletes
and of modern building design. <br><br>In
2013, team Orica-Green Edge set the fastest-ever average speed for a
Tour de France team time trial, with 57.8 km/h over a distance of 25
km, beating team Omega-Pharma Quick-Step by a mere 0.75 s. At the
subsequent 2013 UCI Road World Championships, the latter team beat
the former by only 0.88 s. Clearly, even minor aerodynamic
improvements can be decisive in these prestigious races. And,
surprisingly, up to now, the optimum aerodynamic setting for a team
time trial has not yet been explored.<br><br><p>
Records
in athletics races such as the 100 m sprint, the 110 m hurdles and
the long jump are only validated by the IAAF (International
Association of Athletics Federations) when the tail wind does not exceed
2 m/s. Most world and Olympic records have been established at tail
winds close to 2 m/s. Clearly, local aerodynamic effects can be
decisive in establishing new records. Also here, the optimum
aerodynamic setting has not yet been explored.</p>
<p>
New
and prestigious building projects are realized in different parts of
the world. Some of them feature the integration of wind energy
systems in the building design. Also here, aerodynamic misconceptions
can lead to suboptimal performance. 
</p>
<p>
The
course starts with a brief recapitulation of the basic aspects of
fluid flow: statics, kinematics, dynamics, flow regimes and boundary
layers, including the atmospheric boundary layer in which sports and
building aerodynamics take place. Next, the main aspects of the
aerodynamic analysis techniques of wind tunnel testing and
Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations are outlined. Tips and
tricks for wind tunnel testing and CFD simulations are given. This
knowledge provides the basis for the course parts on building

Title:  An Introduction to Global Health
Short desc:  This course will provide you with an overview of the most important health challenges facing the world today. You will gain insight into how challenges have changed over time, we will discuss the likely determinants of such changes and examine future projections. Successful international strategies and programs promoting human health will be highlighted and global health governance structures will be mapped and the role of the key actors explored.
Long desc:  The course takes its starting point in the belief that good health is intimately linked with personal happiness, productivity, the economic and social development of nations and the advancement of people. <br><br>Globalization processes influence the health of individuals, societies and the function of health systems in many ways and may present opportunities but may also pose a risk to vulnerable societies. Throughout this course presentations will transcend the perspectives of individual countries and will critically discuss how global mega-trends and different sectors of society influence the health of population. Transition in health and the drivers of such transition will be core elements of this course.&nbsp; <br><br>During the six course weeks we will explore a range of themes, including: communicable and non-communicable diseases, environmental health, child health, reproductive health and rights, and health among refugees and displaced populations. We focus on the dual burden of communicable and non-communicable disease experienced by much of the world’s population today.<br><br>As the deadline for meeting the Millennium Development Goals (MDG’s) nears, course participants will also reflect on the post-MDG agenda by exploring the future of global health and trends in technical innovation, global strategies and programs in the fight for better health. Through lectures, readings, and assignments, course participants will be asked to think critically about the health of the world’s population and to reflect on overcoming the challenges of achieving good health around the world. <br>

Title:  Responding to 9/11
Short desc:  9/11 was a devastating attack that required a comprehensive response from the United States. This course will examine post-9/11 U.S. counterterrorism policies regarding the use of military force, law enforcement and intelligence collection, and domestic security. We will trace these policies to the current day and assess their legality, ethics, and efficacy.
Long desc:  This course will examine and evaluate the counterterrorism policies pursued by the United States in response to the 9/11 terrorist attacks.&nbsp; The core learning goal will be for student to learn how to think strategically – that is, to determine what the key objectives the U.S. has been pursuing, critically evaluate whether the policies that have been put in place are achieving these objectives, and consider whether and how these policies should be modified to better meet the U.S.'s strategic goals.&nbsp; Students will have the opportunity to examine counterterrorism policies in three different areas: the use of military force (Afghanistan, Iraq and drones), intelligence and law enforcement authorities (interrogation of enemy combatants, electronic surveillance and government access to data), and homeland security (aviation security and countering violent extremism policy).&nbsp; Each of these topics will require students to grapple with not only questions of efficacy, but also legality and morality. <br><br>The course will be taught in the Fall of 2014. <br>

Title:  Emergence of Life
Short desc:  How did life emerge on Earth? How have life and Earth co-evolved through geological time? Is life elsewhere in the universe? Take a look through the 4-billion-year history of life on Earth through the lens of the modern Tree of Life.
Long desc:  <p>The pioneering work of Professor Carl
Woese on the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign campus has revolutionized
our understanding of the fundamental structure and evolutionary relatedness of
all living entities on Earth. This has resulted in a new "Tree of Life" and a first ever understanding of what life looked like before the
base of the root of the Tree had evolved. <br></p><p>Although these concepts from Woese's
work are central to cutting-edge genome-enabled research in all fields from
medicine to energy, these understandings are currently only minimally (if at
all) taught in classrooms around the world. <br></p><p>This course will evaluate the
entire history of life on Earth within the context of our cutting-edge
understanding of the Tree of Life. This includes reconnaissance of ancient
primordial life before the first cell had evolved, the entire ~4-billion-year
development of single- and multi-celled life through the lens of the Tree of Life, and
the influence of Earth system processes (meteor impacts, volcanoes, ice sheets)
on shaping and structuring the Tree.  This synthesis emphasizes the universality of the
emergence of life as a prelude for the search for extraterrestrial life.</p>

Title:  Introduction to Sustainability
Short desc:  This course introduces the academic discipline of sustainability and explores how today’s human societies can endure in the face of global change, ecosystem degradation and resource limitations.
Long desc:  <div>This course introduces the academic approach of Sustainability and explores how today’s human societies can endure in the face of global change, ecosystem degradation and resource limitations. The course focuses on key knowledge areas of sustainability theory and practice, including population, ecosystems, global change, energy, agriculture, water, environmental economics and policy, ethics, and cultural history.<br><br></div>
<div>This subject is of vital importance, seeking as it does to uncover the principles of the long-term welfare of all the peoples of the planet. As sustainability is a cross-disciplinary field of study, this foundation requires intellectual breadth: as I describe it in the class text, understanding our motivations requires the humanities, measuring the challenges of sustainability requires knowledge of the sciences (both natural and social), and building solutions requires technical insight into systems (such as provided by engineering, planning, and management).</div>

Title:  Our Earth: Its Climate, History, and Processes
Short desc:  Develop a greater appreciation for how the air, water, land, and life formed and have interacted over the last 4.5 billion years.
Long desc:  <p>This course focuses on a basic science understanding that demonstrates how the processes on Earth (including biological processes) lead to natural climate changes that have shaped the planet and the path of evolution. Students are challenged to think of the Earth as an integrated system made up on water, air, ice, land, and life.  <br></p><p>For example, students learn that the Gulf Stream is not the cause of western Europe’s temperate climate. They also learn that the rise of oxygen in the atmosphere 2.5 billion years ago produced massive extinctions of life on Earth that forever altered the dominant types of single-celled life.  Students are exposed to how new scientific discoveries are made through the observations that led to plate tectonics, how the Moon formed, and why dinosaurs went extinct.</p><div><br></div>

Title:  Introduction to Neuroeconomics: how the brain makes decisions
Short desc:  Economics, psychology, and neuroscience are converging today into a unified discipline of Neuroeconomics with the ultimate aim of providing a single, general theory of human decision making. 
Neuroeconomics provides economists, psychologists and social scientists with a deeper understanding of how they make their own decisions, and how others decide. 

Long desc:  <p>Economics,
psychology, and neuroscience are converging today into a unified discipline of
Neuroeconomics with the ultimate aim of providing a single, general theory of
human behaviour. </p>

<p>Neuroeconomics
can provide economists and social scientists with a deeper
understanding of how they make their own decisions, and how others decide. Are
we hard-wired to be risk-adverse or risk-takers? How is a “fair decision”
evaluated by the brain? Is it possible today to predict the purchasing
intentions of a consumer? Can we modulate economic behaviour affecting the
brain?</p>

<p>Neuroscience
allied to psychology and economics have powerful models and evidence to explain
why we make a decision… and whether it is rational or not. Decision-making in
financial markets, trust and cooperation in teams, consumer persuasion, will be
central issues in this course in neuroeconomics. You will be provided with the
most recent evidence from brain-imaging techniques (PET, fMRI and TMS), and you
will be introduced to the explanatory models behind them.</p>

<p>The
course will start by discussing the foundations of neuroeconomics and the
neuroanatomy of the brain (Module I: “How the brain works”).</p>

<p>Module II
(“How the brain decides”) then focuses on the core building block of
neuroeconomics: decision theory. In a simple way, you will be presented with
the main theories accounting for how individuals decide, supported by key
empirical studies.</p>

<p>The next
module will study the balance between rationality and emotions (Module III: “How
the brain feels”): how our emotions interfere with our so-called rational
judgments.</p>

<p>Module IV
(“Society of brains”) focuses on society: how groups and the social environment
interact with individual decision-making. This module will have strong implications
for marketing, public policy and public education.</p>

Title:  Финансовые рынки и институты (Financial Markets and Institutions)
Short desc:  Вы узнаете, как функционируют финансовые рынки и финансовые институты. Каким образом компании привлекают капитал для своего развития, а также как инвестировать на финансовом рынке.
<br>
You will learn how the financial markets and institutions operate, how companies can attract capital for their development and also how to invest in the financial market.
Long desc:  <span>В рамках
данного курса рассматриваются глобальные преобразования, которые трансформируют
финансовые рынки, вовлекают в финансовый оборот новые институты, способствуют
появлению новых финансовых инструментов, меняют подходы к регулированию
финансовых рынков.<br></span><p>В настоящее
время компании, регионы и государство активно используют финансовый рынок для
привлечения финансовых ресурсов, обеспечивающих реализацию инвестиционных
проектов. Финансовый рынок востребован, как со стороны финансовых институтов,
так и частных инвесторов, которые используют его для инвестирования временно
свободных денежных средств с целью получения дохода на вложенный капитал.</p><p>Финансовый
рынок очень подвижен и претерпевает существенные изменения. Мы рассмотрим
наиболее заметные события последнего времени, характеризующие развитие мирового
финансового рынка и российского рынка в частности, среди которых следует
отметить:</p><p></p><ul><li>серию финансовых кризисов, которые
потрясли мировое финансовое сообщество и заставили инвесторов более здраво оценивать
риски инвестирования;<br></li><li>глобализацию финансовых рынков,
которая стирает грани между национальными рынками и способствует интеграции
российского финансового рынка в мировую финансовую систему;<br></li><li>интенсивное развитие процессов
секьюритизации финансовых рынков и активов;<br></li><li>развитие финансовой инженерии и
появление новых финансовых инструментов.<br></li></ul><p></p><p><br></p><p>This course examines the global changes that transform financial markets, involve new institutions in financial
circulation, contribute to the emergence
of new financial instruments, and transform the approaches to the regulation of
financial markets.&nbsp;</p><p>At
present companies, regions and the state actively use the financial market to raise funds for investment projects. The financial market is attractive not only to financial
institutions but also to private investors, who use it for investing temporarily free funds for the purpose of obtaining
income on invested capital.</p><p>The
financial market is very changeable and undergoes significant changes. In this course, we'll consider the most noticeable
events of recent date affecting global financial markets and the Russian market in
particular, including:</p><p></p><ul><li>a series of financial crises that shook the world
financial community and made investors more sensibly assess the risks of investing;<br></li><li>globalization of financial markets, which eliminated the distinction between national markets and promoted the integration of the Russian
financial market into the global financial system;<br></li><li>the intensive development of the securitization processes
of the financial markets and assets;<br></li><li>the development of financial engineering and the
emergence of new financial instruments.&nbsp;<br></li></ul><p></p>

Title:  Understanding Russians: Contexts of Intercultural Communication
Short desc:  Learn about the intercultural communication process using Russian –Western communication as an example. 
Look at the interrelations between different contexts (cultural, institutional, professional, social, interpersonal) of communication focusing on cultural history and national psychology of Russians.

Long desc:  <p><span>The main
focus of this course is to look at the interrelations between different types
of contexts (<i>cultural, institutional, professional, social, interpersonal</i>
and others) within the intercultural communication process using Russian – Western
communication as an example.</span></p>

<p>The purpose of the course is to provide the students
with a broad overview of the basic principles governing past, present and
future interactions between Russia and the West focused on the culture and national
psychology of Russians and Western Europeans.</p>

<p>This course looks at the cases when Russian basic cultural values show
up through linguistic choices shaping language production which is consequently
misattributed by Western partners.  No
matter what the language of intercultural communication is - Russian, or
English - the meaning of many linguistic expressions may be reconstructed
wrongly by the representatives of another culture.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>We will
tackle some basic questions:</p>

<ul>
 <li>What are concepts of culture
     that have most influence on communication?</li>
 <li>What are Russian basic cultural
     values and how they shape modern Russian consciousness?</li>
 <li> What are specific communication patterns
     of modern Russian, including that of public and electronic discourse? </li>
 <li>What is important to know about
     communication with Russians in organizational contexts?</li></ul><br>

This course is NOT just a list of instructions
of what to do and not to do while dealing with Russians

Title:  Основы корпоративных финансов (Fundamentals of Corporate Finance)
Short desc:  Мы рассмотрим принципы и модели финансового анализа компании, а также оценку стратегических решений компании с точки зрения их влияния на фундаментальную стоимость компании.
In this course you will learn the principles and models of financial analysis of a firm based on the criteria of value creation.

Long desc:  <p>Курс посвящен новой для российской
практики  методологии анализа компании,
сфокусированной на задаче максимизации ее фундаментальной стоимости. Он основан
на концепциях современной финансовой теории и выходит далеко за рамки
интерпретации финансовой отчетности компании. 
</p>

<p>Применяя принципы универсальной
финансовой теории, мы  тем не менее
отразим специфику российского рынка капитала, котoрый относится к группе развивающихся рынков. Курс
основан на изучении публичных компаний, 
однако его концепции применимы к компаниям любой организационно-правовой
формы. </p>

<p>Мы сфокусируемся на анализе ключевых
корпоративных решений: решений о привлечении капитала и решений об инвестициях.
Инвестиционные решения – это выбор компанией проектов для долгосрочных вложений.
Наша задача : научить вас современным методам оценки и критериям выбора
инвестиционных проектов и формирования портфеля таких проектов .  Решения о привлечении капитала – это выбор
источников финансирования инвестиций (внутренние средства, заемные средства,
средства привлеченные путем выпуска новых акций). Наша задача – объяснить
мотивы выбора конкретной комбинации 
инструментов финансирования в компании и показать, чем определяется
оптимальная структура капитала компании (соотношение заемного и собственного
капитала).<br></p>

<p>Мы также рассмотрим решения компании о
выплатах акционерам, и продемонстрируем как полученные в этом курсе знания
позволяют оценивать стоимость компании в целом, с учетом выбранной структуры
капитала.<br></p>

<p>In
this course we will present the modern approach to analysis of a company, with
a focus on value maximization. We will apply the principles of the modern
finance theory. At the same time, we will show how to take into account
specificities of a typical firm in an emerging market, such as Russia.<br></p>

<p>The
core of the course is the analysis of financing, investment and payout
decisions of a firm. We will teach you the principles and techniques of
selecting projects for investment. We will examine the determinants of the
capital structure choices by firms as well as the notion of the optimal capital
structure. We will analyze how firms decide on their payouts to shareholders
and what the optimal payout policy should be. Finally, we will show how to
value a company, taking into account its capital structure, and discuss the
effects of corporate governance on firm value.</p>

Title:  Макроэкономика (Macroeconomics)
Short desc:  Курс посвящен изучению макроэкономических вопросов, таких как долгосрочный рост, циклические колебания экономики и стабилизационная политика государства.

The course covers major macroeconomic issues, such as long-run growth, cyclical fluctuations of the economy, and stabilization policy. 
Long desc:  <p>Данный курс
покрывает на базовом уровне все основные темы макроэкономики. Примерно две
трети курса посвящены анализу общего равновесия на рынках труда, заемных
средств, финансовых, денежных, товарных рынках, а также международных потоков
капитала. Изучается долгосрочный экономический рост, идущий за счет накопления
капитальных мощностей и технического прогресса.&nbsp;
Вторая часть курса посвящена изучению природы краткосрочных колебаний
вокруг долгосрочной траектории роста, таким как финансовый кризис и мировая
рецессия 2008-2009 годов. Обсуждаются причины подобных спадов, а также
оптимальная стабилизационная политика государства, призванная либо
предотвращать подобные катаклизмы, либо сглаживать последствия от них.</p><p><br></p><p>This course provides a basic introduction to the major macroeconomic issues. The first and somewhat bigger part of the course is dedicated to the description of the general equilibrium in the economy, including the labor market, market for loanable funds, financial market, money market, and the goods market, as well as international capital flows. This part also covers long-term growth, associated with accumulation of capital and technological progress. The second part of the course is dedicated to the analysis of the short-term fluctuations around the long-term growth trend, such as the world financial crisis and the global recession of 2008-2009. We will discuss causes of such recessions, and the optimal stabilization policy called to prevent and mitigate the consequences of such economic catastrophes.</p>

Title:  Теория отраслевых рынков (Industrial Organization)
Short desc:  Курс посвящен закономерностям конкуренции, рассматриваемой в рамках концепции стратегического взаимодействия продавцов, включая олигополистическую конкуренцию и решения укоренившегося продавца, сталкивающегося с опасностью входа.
Explore the factors that determine firm size and market structures by analyzing the strategic decisions made by market participants.
Long desc:  Курс
посвящен факторам, влияющим на размер компаний и структуру рынка. Почему на
одной группе рынков преобладают малые компании, а на другом крупные? Продавцы
принимают решения стратегически, однако их стимулы в свою очередь зависят от
структуры рынка и от предшествующих решений. Как разделить между зоной
предопределенных и свободных решений? <br>Cпособны ли укоренившиеся на рынке продавцы препятствовать входу новичков, защищая свою рыночную долю и свою прибыль? Как в этих условиях должна быть организована государственная политика (антитраст и регулирование)? Каковы лучшие способы предотвращения ценовых сговоров продавцов? Нужно ли (или по крайней мере желательно) запрещать или ограничивать слияния между крупными продавцами? Как в этих условиях должна быть
организована государственная политика (антитраст и регулирование)?<br><br>The course
explores the factors that determine firm size and market structure. Why do small firms
dominate in one group of the market and very large firms in the others? Market
participants make decisions strategically, but their incentives are affected by
market structure as well as their past choices. How do we distinguish between
determined and ‘free choice’ areas in competition and market structures? How should public policy (including antitrust and regulation) be designed?

Title:  Основы микроэкономики (Microeconomics Principles)
Short desc:  Самое сложное экономическое событие сводится, в конечном счёте, к действиям отдельных людей и фирм. Микроэкономика показывает, как можно эти действия анализировать – как люди выбирают, что потреблять, а фирмы – что производить.
Microeconomic theory tells how people decide what to consume, and firms – what to produce and how to win over their competitors in the market.

Long desc:  <p>В базовом
курсе микроэкономики рассказывается об основных инструментах экономического
анализа, которые позволяют изучать наиболее важные закономерности в поведении
людей и фирм. У людей есть предпочтения относительно товаров и бюджетные
ограничения, у фирм – производственные возможности и спрос на их продукцию со
стороны людей. В результате взаимодействия людей и фирм складываются рынки,
на которых определяется цена – важнейший канал передачи информации.</p><p>Чтобы информации было больше, существуют рынки, на
которых продаются и покупаются товары и услуги. Потребитель никогда не купит
нужный ему товар, если не узнает, где и как его можно купить. Производитель не
станет его изготавливать, если не будет уверен, что найдется покупатель,
который его приобретет. Каждый человек и каждая фирма обладает какими-то
сведениями – прежде всего о себе самом, о своих вкусах, интересах, потребностях
и возможностях. Однако информации у всех становится во много раз больше, когда
субъекты начинают взаимодействовать – производят и потребляют, продают, покупают
и меняются. Поведение людей и фирм на рынках – основной предмет изучения в
курсе микроэкономики.</p><p>The introductory course in Microeconomics describes the basic instruments of economic analysis, which allow us to study the most important patterns in the behavior of people and firms. As a result of their interactions markets occur and prices are determined. Microeconomics studies the behavior of people and firms in the markets.</p>

Title:  История экономической мысли (History of Economic Thought)
Short desc:  Курс поможет осмыслить извечные проблемы жизни человека: богатство и бедность, деньги и рынки, инфляция и безработица, индивидуальные решения и государственная политика.
The course will help you to understand the lasting economic problems of everyday human life: wealth and poverty, money and markets, inflation and unemployment, human decisions and governmental policies. 
Long desc:  <p>Свои повседневные экономические решения –&nbsp;<i>что купить, куда пойти работать, как сберечь накопленный доход</i>&nbsp;– человек обычно принимает без сложных расчетов, руководствуясь здравым смыслом. Не всегда, к сожалению, здравый смысл оказывается достаточно просвещенным и тренированным.&nbsp;</p><p>Экономические понятия, которыми мы мыслим, складывались в разные эпохи и несут, порой, совсем не тот смысл, который мы по инерции в них вкладываем. Мы копим деньги, порой, так, как это делали наши предки столетия тому назад, хотя деньги тогда были из драгоценных металлов, а ныне они бумажные. Мы легко ссылаемся на рост ВВП, плохо осознавая, что за этим стоит. Мы верим обещаниям политиков сделать нашу жизнь богатой и счастливой, не различая, каким обещаниям можно верить, а какими нас откровенно обманывают. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>История экономической мысли – это квинтэссенция опыта решения сложных проблем хозяйственной жизни; опыта, который складывался в борьбе идей, отражавших конфликтующие социальные интересы. В нашем курсе обобщаются уроки выдающихся экономических мыслителей: Адама Смита и Карла Маркса, Леона Вальраса и Йозефа Шумпетера, Торстейна Веблена и Николая Кондратьева, Джона М. Кейнса и др. Мы будем разбираться в том, как, отвечая на вызовы своего времени, они создавали корпус современного экономического знания с его возможностями и ограничениями. Тем самым мы рассчитываем сделать ваш экономический здравый смысл более тренированным и просвещенным.<br></p><p><br></p><p>We tend to make&nbsp;<span>everyday economic decisions – <i>what to buy, what job to choose, how to save one's income</i> – without complicated calculations, instead relying on common sense.
Unfortunately, common sense does not always appear to be enlightened and
trained enough.</span></p>

<p>Economic conceptions, with which we think, were shaped
in different epochs and often bear not that very sense we tend to put into
them. We sometimes accumulate money in a way our predecessors did, although at
that time it was gold or silver, while now we deal with just paper. We easily
refer to GDP, being hardly aware of complexities behind this notion. We believe
to politicians promising to make our life wealthy and happy, not distinguishing
reliable promises from those just fooling us.&nbsp;</p>

<p>History of economic thought is a distillation of experiences in solving complicated
problems of economic life – experiences that were shaped in struggle of ideas
with conflicting social interests behind them. In our course we summarize
lessons of outstanding economic thinkers, such as Adam Smith and Karl Marx,
Leon Walras and Joseph Schumpeter, Torstein Veblen and Nikolai Kondratieff,
John M. Keynes and others. We shall analyze how responding to the challenges of
their times they created the corps of our economic knowledge with its powers
and limitations. Thus we hope to make your economic common sense more
enlightened and better trained.</p>

Title:  Animal Behaviour and Welfare
Short desc:  Animal welfare has been described as a complex, multi-faceted public policy issue which includes important scientific, ethical, and other dimensions. Improving our understanding of  animal welfare, involves the fascinating study of animal behavior as well as the challenge of accessing the emotions of animals. 
Long desc:  <p><span>Animals occupy a huge part of the planet and
our lives, and although we rely on them for all aspects of our own wellbeing - food, draught power, medical advances, clothing, sport as well as pleasure,
protection and comfort - often their quality of life is questionable. Appreciating how animal's&nbsp;experience the world they live in and&nbsp;the different behavioural needs of the various species we&nbsp;interact with,&nbsp;enables us to gain a better&nbsp;understanding of their welfare requirements, so that long term improvements to animal lives can be made.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br></span>
</p>
<p><span>There are now more than 60 billion
land animals raised for meat <i>each year</i> around the world, and with
increasing human populations and a rise in meat consumption in many parts of the world, these figures are set to double by 2050. Added to this is a huge and growing&nbsp;world population of dogs and cats, many of whom are strays&nbsp;with associated health and welfare issues.&nbsp;&nbsp;International concern for animal welfare
continues to grow with rising demand for measures to protect animals and
improve their care and wellbeing. The link between animal welfare and human
wellbeing is clear, and yet we still have a long way to go if we are to address
welfare needs globally. Finding ways to </span>achieve higher standards of animal welfare, is therefore a key priority for any developed and developing nation. Due to gaining in importance internationally, there is increasing recognition of the need for animal welfare issues to be addressed objectively in a scientifically credible manner. <br></p><p>In this animal behaviour and welfare course, you will learn about animal welfare and why it matters, develop an understanding of some of the main welfare issues animals have to cope with as well as gaining an insight into the behavioural needs and the emotions&nbsp;of dogs, cats, farmed animals and
    captive wildlife.</p>

Title:  AstroTech: The Science and Technology behind Astronomical Discovery
Short desc:  How astronomy really works - an overview of the technology that astronomers use to collect and measure light from the universe, and how it is used in practice to make scientific discoveries.

Long desc:  "How do they know that?"
<br><br>Modern astronomy has made some astonishing discoveries - how stars burn and how black holes form; galaxies from the edge of the universe and killer rocks right next door; where the elements come from and how the expanding universe is accelerating. But
    how do we know all that? The truth is that astronomy would be impossible without technology, and every advance in astronomy is really an advance in technology. But the technology by itself is not enough. We have to apply it critically with a knowledge
    of physics to unlock the secrets of the Universe.
    <br><br>Each week we will cover a different aspect of Astronomical technology, matching each piece of technology to a highlight science result.   We will explain how the technology works, how it has allowed us to collect astronomical data, and, with
    some basic physics, how we the interpret the data to make scientific discoveries. <br><br>

Title:  English Composition I: Achieving Expertise
Short desc:  You will gain a foundation for college-level writing valuable for nearly any field. Students will learn how to read carefully, write effective arguments, understand the writing process, engage with others' ideas, cite accurately, and craft powerful prose. We will create a workshop environment. 
Long desc:  <p>English Composition I provides an introduction to and foundation for the academic reading and writing characteristic of college. Attending explicitly to disciplinary context, you will learn to read critically, write effective arguments, understand the
    writing process, and craft powerful prose that meets readers’ expectations. You will gain writing expertise by exploring questions about expertise itself: What factors impact expert achievement? What does it take to succeed? Who determines success?
    Since personal investment yields better writing, you can select an area of expertise meaningful to you (a hobby, trade, profession, discipline, etc.) for your major writing projects, which will be drafted and revised in sequenced stages: a critical
    review to an argument about expertise (600-800 words); an explication of a visual image (600-800 words); a case study of an expert (1000-1250 words) and an Op-Ed (500-750 words). Your writing will be central to the course as we create a seminar/workshop
    structure with peer response and selected instructor feedback.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Two overarching assumptions about academic writing will shape our work:&nbsp; 1) it is transferable; 2) it is learnable. Being an effective academic writer involves asking meaningful questions and engaging in complex dialogue with texts and ideas. These
    skills are useful across virtually all academic disciplines and they provide a valuable means for making sense of non-academic experiences as well. Perhaps even more important, though, is that learning how to write effectively does not require inspiration
    or genius, but hard work, reflection, and feedback. This means that, with practice, dedication, and working with others,<i> you</i> can be an effective academic writer and contribute your ideas to important, ongoing conversations. Let's start now.</p><p><a title="Link: https://duke.qualtrics.com/SE/?SID=SV_eWEH2NWLXc39gJT" target="_blank" href="https://duke.qualtrics.com/SE/?SID=SV_eWEH2NWLXc39gJT">Share why you want to improve your writing</a></p><p><a target="_blank" href="https://duke.qualtrics.com/CP/Report.php?RP=RP_3a5VBt61u1FYim9">Learn what other says about their motivations</a><br></p><p><span>**English Composition I has earned a <a title="Link: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/composition%2Fquality%20matters%20certificate%5B2%5D.pdf" href="https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/composition%2Fquality%20matters%20certificate%5B2%5D.pdf">Certificate of Recognition</a> from Quality Matters, a non-profit dedicated to quality in online education.**

Title:  Paradoxes of War
Short desc:  An introduction into the historical, psychological, and sociological analysis of organized conflict.
Long desc:  <p>The Paradox of War teaches us to understand that war is not only a normal part of human existence, but is arguably one of the most important factors in making us who we are. Through this course, I hope that you will come to appreciate that war is both a natural expression of common human emotions and interactions and a constitutive part of how we cohere as groups. That is, war is paradoxically an expression of our basest animal nature and the exemplar of our most vaunted and valued civilized virtues. You will learn some basic military history and sociology in this course as a lens for the more important purpose of seeing the broader social themes and issues related to war. I want you to both learn about war, but more importantly, use it as way of understanding your everyday social world So, for example, the discussion of war and gender will serve to start you thinking about how expectations of masculinity are created and our discussion of nationalism will make clear how easy “us-them” dichotomies can be established and (ab)used. I will suggest some readings for you to complement the class and assign some activities through which you will be able to apply the theoretical insights from the course to your observations of everyday life. At the end of the course, you will start to see war everywhere and come to appreciate how much it defines our life.</p>

Title:  Introduction to Systems Engineering
Short desc:  Learn how the discipline of systems engineering can lead to the successful development of complex systems.
Long desc:  Systems engineering is an interdisciplinary approach to design, implementation and evaluation that holds the key to the successful development of complex human-made systems. This course explores a framework encapsulating the entire systems engineering discipline, clearly showing where the multitude of associated activities fits within the overall effort and how the activities relate to one another.  Systems engineering is a very broad discipline, so we also discuss how the concepts and procedures could be applied to individual projects. A new theme will be explored each week using presentations to introduce and synthesise key concepts, examples to simulate authentic contexts, and structured activities to guide your learning. <br><br>The course is relevant to all professions associated with the introduction of complex human-made systems: project managers, engineers, quality assurance representatives, integrated logistic support practitioners, operators, managers, maintainers, and so on, from students to professionals, from novices to experienced practitioners, from technical to non-technical people. <br><br>

Title:  Mechanics: Motion, Forces, Energy and Gravity, from Particles to Planets
Short desc:  Mechanics is the basis of much of physics, engineering and other technological disciplines. It begins by quantifying motion, and then explaining it in terms of forces, energy, momentum and forces including gravity. This allows us to analyse the operation of many familiar phenomena around us, but also the mechanics of planets, stars and galaxies.
Long desc:  <p>Most of the phenomena in the world around you are, at the fundamental level, based on physics, and much of physics is based on mechanics. You will understand with greater depth many of the wonders around you in everyday life, in technology, in the universe at large. That, in turn, will lead you to look further and deeper into the world and the universe around you. Meanwhile, we think you'll have some fun, too.<br></p><p>
This course uses rich multimedia
 tutorials to present the material: film clips of key experiments, 
animations and worked example problems, all with a friendly narrator. 
You'll then do a range of interesting problems to
 practise what you've learnt, and for assessment. You will use your 
ingenuity to come up with two experimental investigations using simple, 
everyday materials (plus a computer). </p>

Title:  Public Economics
Short desc:  This course deals with the economic role of the state and explores factors that affect government performance. Both normative economic theories of the state and positive analyses of government’s involvement in the private sector will be presented. 
Long desc:  <p>In this course
I will cover main features and dilemmas of government’s role and presence in
the private sector and the society. Unlike conventional public economic courses
that concentrate on taxation and public expenditures, I will offer a modern
multidisciplinary perspective of government as an economic agent.</p>

<p>The course
will summarize a vast body of empirical evidence from around the world as to
what factors make governments more or less efficient. </p>

<p>Of primary
interest will be the agency relations between government and society, i.e. ways
and means to ensure government accountability and prevention of the abuse of
power. Accordingly we will discuss the impact of constitutions and political
regimes on government performance. The course will also deal with how the size
of government and state capacity affect development, and how those evolve over
time.</p>

<p>We will
discuss proper scope of government – what programs and services the state
should administer itself, and which of those should better be outsourced to
private firms – perhaps in the private-public partnership format. </p>

<p>An
important theme of the course will be the choice of appropriate tools for
government intervention, and in particular - the tradeoff between public
regulation, by  resolving disputes by
courts, and by opting for self-regulation and other private sector mechanisms. </p>

<p>We will
discuss government pathologies, most and foremost corruption and ways and means
to keep it under control. The dual role of civil society as an alternative to government
and factor of government accountability will be explored. </p><span id="_wysihtml5-undo" class="_wysihtml5-temp"></span><p></p>

Title:  Introduction to Pharmacy
Short desc:  This course is a survey of the profession of pharmacy including its history, evolving scope of practice, ethical foundations, regulation, educational and career opportunities, and more. We will also explore topics relating to medication use and drug development.
Long desc:  <b></b>

<p>Man has always used external materials to help prevent, cure, or alleviate
    the symptoms of disease. In fact, Gregory Higby of the American Institute
    of the History of Pharmacy has written that, “...the very concept
    of influencing bodily functions via an outside force must be considered
    one of humanity’s greatest advances.” Since its independent origins
    in ancient Arabic civilizations, pharmacy has evolved from a craft dedicated
    to the compounding of drugs to a profession focusing on helping patients
    get the best outcomes from medication therapies.</p>
<p>So what is pharmacy? How has it changed and where is it headed?</p>
<p>This course will answer these questions and provide a comprehensive introduction
    to this profession. We will explore the history of pharmacy and its evolving
    scope of practice; examine educational and career pathways; tackle issues
    relating to medication safety and adverse drug events; gain insight into
    the regulatory and ethical considerations in pharmacy practice; and more.</p>
<p>As we explore these topics together, we will hear from practicing pharmacists
    throughout the course and ultimately gain a better understanding of what
    they do and how they help us get the best results from our medications.
    Maybe you will decide that the dynamic profession of pharmacy is a career
    path that you want to pursue!  Whether student or healthcare consumer,
    you’re sure to find the material we cover in this course to be invaluable.</p>

Title:  数学之旅 The Journey of Mathematics
Short desc:  课程从问题开始揭示一些数学思想形成的过程，和听众一起从思想上重走一遍前辈们走过的路，体会数学抽象的魅力。

In this course I share the processes which formed the core concepts of mathematical philosophy, walking with students as they experience, learn and enjoy mathematical abstraction.
Long desc:  <p>    数学的重要特征是它的抽象性，这一特征是令人生畏的。但也正是这一特征可以使人们在繁杂的世界中逐步懂得宇宙深处伟大设计图的语言；可以用理性的思维达到超出人类感官所及的宇宙的根本。而这一切正是数学的魅力所在，也是数学在人类历史上起着其它科学不可替代作用的重要原因。但这也是很多学生畏惧数学或学习数学的困难所在。</p><p>Abstraction in mathematics, one of its most important features, can often 
seem forbidding. However, this abstract thinking also reveals the great mystery 
of the Universe and demonstrates fundamentally why mathematics is both charming 
and irreplaceable. Unfortunately, it makes too many students afraid of 
mathematics and causes trouble for the study of mathematics.</p><p> 本课程针对这一情况，试图和学生一起从思想上重走一遍前辈们走过的路，作一次轻松的数学之旅。在这一旅途中我们不断揭示一些概念和数学思想形成的过程和历史，理解数学抽象的必要性和魅力，真实体会数学抽象所表现出的人类心智的荣耀，潜移默化地从中培养数学抽象的能力。并试图就一些简单的数学例子介绍数学抽象的一些特点，并试图就学习数学时，如何克服抽象带来的困难谈一些看法。主讲人有信心使这门课程成为一次轻松的“抽象”旅游。并希望对学生的数学课程的学习和数学思维的形成，在心理和心智上都有所帮助。</p>

<p>In this course, I try to walk along its history together with students to 
create a relaxed tour of mathematical concepts and thinking. This course will 
share the history and process of the formation of some mathematical concepts and 
philosophy, help students to understand the need for abstraction in mathematics, 
and teach students how to enjoy what is behind these abstract concepts so that 
they may handle them more confidently. We also try to show certain features of 
abstraction in mathematics through some simple examples that will teach students 
how to overcome common difficulties. I am confident this course will be 
enjoyable and helpful for those studying mathematics and the formation of 
mathematical thinking.<br></p>

<p>好的旅游不是旅游点的累积，而是心与自然、心与心的交流。我们的“数学之旅”不期待你知道了多少数学概念，而期待你开始对数学的抽象有了体会，意识到数学的抽象其实不“抽象”，感受到数学思维所表现出的人类心智的荣耀。</p>

<p>In this journey, the important thing is the interaction between heart and 
nature and heart and heart, instead of the number of viewpoints. We do not 
expect that you will master many mathematical concepts but hope you will learn 
about and develop an appreciation for the abstraction of 
mathematics.<br></p>

Title:  法与社会   Law and Society
Short desc:         “法与社会”这门课程要在多层多样的社会关系中解读法律，并且透过法律来考察和把握社会的各种现象。本课程将课堂讲授与媒体教学有机结合，使学生对法社会学有一概括了解，用比较的眼光对法律制度和规范的内容进行分析，对中国法律传统及其演变进行准确定位。


       "Law and Society" aims to offer both readings of law that vary with the diversity of social relations and understandings of social events from the legal perspective. This module, through a combination of lectures with multimedia presentation, is designed to enable the students to gain a general knowledge of sociology, to analyse legal institutions and norms by comparative means, and to have a clearer idea of the legal tradition and its evolution in China.      
Long desc:  <p><b></b>       一百余年来，人类生活的动态化、复杂化趋势越来越明显。尤其是货币、权力、技术、信息等媒介系统的发达，打破了传统文化的藩篱和主权国家的疆界，加速了制度变迁。进入二十一世纪后，社会的风险性、相对性、不确定性进一步增强。</p>

<p>       在这样的背景下，中国法律与审判的现存模式也面临日新月异的形势压力，受到来自不同方面的挑战。为了更好地解决现实问题，立法机关、执法部门、法官、检察官以及律师们都必须更透彻地分析、理解以及反思社会环境。为了根据客观需要改善法律制度，无论借鉴外国的经验还是在试错过程中进行创新，人们都必须精通关于社会的各种知识和思想。</p>

<p>      中国社会是一个超大规模的复杂系统。其中人际关系网络纵横交错，发挥非常重要的自组织化作用。在这里，无论个体还是群体，行为方式和思维方式都很有文化特色，同时又贯穿着具有普遍意义的实践理性。以此为基础，社会规范体系的构成、法律制度设计、审判实务、权利意识、关于公正的社会心理以及秩序形成的机制都构成比较法学上的一种典型。本课程采取“法与社会”研究范式的视角，通过法律现象观察中国社会的结构和功能，在中国社会的语境中解释法律现象。特别是以日常经验、事实以及具体案例为线索，分析法律传统的演变和建构法治秩序的条件，并且深入阐述把“原则”嵌入合理行为之中的法治新范式对网络社会和风险社会的价值涵义。</p><p>课程片花地址：<a href="http://v.youku.com/v_show/id_XNjQyMDExMzA0.html" title="Link: http://v.youku.com/v_show/id_XNjQyMDExMzA0.html">http://v.youku.com/v_show/id_XNjQyMDExMzA0.html</a></p><p><b>Module Introduction:</b></p><p>        The past century
has witnessed an apparent development that has increasingly complicated the
dynamics of human life, especially with regard to the advancement in such media
systems as currency, power, and technology that drives forward institutional
evolution by traversing distances that are not only spatio-temporal, but also
cultural and national (based on the nation-state sovereignty). The 21st
century also opens up an ever-intensifying degree of social risks, relativity
and uncertainty.</p><p>       It is against this general background
that the existing model of law and judiciary in China has been subject to
cross-cutting pressures. A better analysis, understanding and reflection of the
general social milieu thus becomes a matter of necessity should law-makers,
law-enforcers, judges, prosecutors and lawyers seek better solutions in
practice. An pragmatic adjustment of legal institutions to contemporary needs,
be it by means of learning from other countries or of the trial-and-error
process of innovation, will not be possible unless we are equipped with better
social knowledge and greater familiarity with the history of thoughts.</p><p>       Needless to say, the Chinese society is a
super-large-scale complex system, of which cross-cutting social networks play
an ultimately important role of self-organisation. Here, individual or
group-based ways of conduct and thinking are culturally distinctive, albeit
with consistent practical reason of universal implications – a basis upon which
there arise such comparative-law prototypes as of the constitution of social
norms, the design of legal institutions, judiciary practice, the awareness of
rights, justice-related social psychology, and the mechanism of ordering. With
a “law and society” perspective, this module aims to put the Chinese social
structure and its function under microscopic observation through legal lens,
while as its obverse, to interpret legal phenomena in the Chinese social
context. In particular, daily routines, facts and concrete cases will be used
to map the evolution of legal traditions, analyse the conditions for
constituting a rule-of-law order, and reveal the value implications on our
networked and risk society of a new rule-of-law paradigm with “principles”
embedded within rational actions.</p><p> </p>

Title:  Core Concepts in Data Analysis
Short desc:  Learn both theory and application for basic methods that have been invented either for developing new concepts – principal components or clusters, or for finding interesting correlations – regression and classification.   This is preceded by a thorough analysis of 1D and 2D data.
Long desc:  <p>This is an
unconventional course in modern Data Analysis, Machine Learning and Data
Mining. Its contents are heavily influenced by the idea that data analysis
should help in enhancing and augmenting knowledge of the domain as represented
by the concepts and statements of relation between them. According to this
view, two main pathways for data analysis are summarization, for developing and
augmenting concepts, and correlation, for enhancing and establishing relations.
The term summarization embraces here both simple summaries like totals and
means and more complex summaries: the principal
components of a set of features and cluster structures in a set of entities.
Similarly, correlation covers both bivariate and multivariate relations between
input and target features including Bayes classifiers.</p>

<span>The view of the data as a subject of
computational data analysis that is adhered to here has emerged quite recently.
Typically, in sciences and in statistics, a problem comes first, and then the
investigator turns to data that might be useful in advancing towards a
solution. Yet nowadays the situation is reversed frequently, especially with
the advent of Big Data. Typical questions then are: Take a look at this data
set - what sense can be made out of it? – Is there any structure in the data
set? Can these features help in predicting those? This is more reminiscent to a
traveler’s view of the world rather than that of a scientist. The scientist
sits at his desk, gets reproducible signals from the universe and tries to accommodate
them into a great model of the universe. The traveler deals with what come on
their way – here is the data analysis niche. 
A textbook by the instructor along these lines has been published by
Springer-London in 2011: “Core
concepts in data analysis is clean and devoid
of any fuzziness. The author presents his theses with a refreshing clarity
seldom seen in a text of this sophistication. … To single out just one of the
text’s many successes: I doubt readers will ever encounter again such a detailed
and excellent treatment of correlation concepts. (Computing Reviews of
ACM, June 2011).</span>”<b></b><b></b><p></p>

Title:  Globalization of Business Enterprise
Short desc:  The majority of businesses say they want to become more global. And business leaders say that the lack of people with global intelligence is the key constraint holding them back. This course will address both gaps — at the business and the personal level, it will focus on practical strategies for dealing with the real consequences of globalization.



Long desc:  <p>The GLOBE course was developed and refined during the term of Professor Ghemawat’s 
membership of the AACSB taskforce on the globalization of business education. <br></p><p>This
course begins by debunking some of the many myths that surround globalization—what
Professor Ghemawat refers to as "globaloney".</p>

<p>After
discussing what globalization isn’t, this course devotes several sessions to
understanding what globalization is. It
will focus on the differences between countries that underlie observed levels
of globalization and their implications for business. These differences will be summarized in terms
of a framework for thinking about distances developed by Professor Ghemawat
that is widely used at leading business schools around the world.</p>

<p>The final part of the course will synthesize the
implications of globalization for business strategies—and for your personal
development and career trajectories.  </p><p>Praise</p><p><b>"Pankaj Ghemawat is one of those rare individuals who combines world class scholarship with a deep knowledge of business practice." </b><br></p><p><i>Michael E. Porter, Bishop William Lawrence</i> <i>University Professor, Harvard Business School</i></p><p><b>“Pankaj Ghemawat’s framework is both visionary and pragmatic—aware of the broad historic trajectories of globalization, but grounded in the real kinds of decisions business leaders have to make now.”</b><br><i>Samuel J. Palmisano, Former Chairman and CEO, IBM</i><br><br><b>“Pankaj Ghemawat has provided an impressive and comprehensive analysis of the world’s situation in times of globalization and strong economic and social imbalances."</b><br><i>Mohammed Yunus, Winner of the Nobel Prize for Peace</i><br></p>

Title:  Statistical Molecular Thermodynamics
Short desc:  This introductory physical chemistry course examines the connections between molecular properties and the behavior of macroscopic chemical systems.
Long desc:  <p>Statistical Molecular Thermodynamics is a course in physical chemistry
that relates the microscopic properties of molecules to the macroscopic behavior
of chemical systems. Quantized molecular energy levels and their use in the
construction of molecular and ensemble partition functions is described.
Thermodynamic state functions, their dependence on the partition function, and
their relationships with one another (as dictated by the three Laws of
Thermodynamics) are all examined in detail. Analysis and demonstration takes
place primarily in the context of ideal and real gases. This eight-week course
covers slightly more than half of a typical semester-long course in chemical
thermodynamics. Typical topics to be addressed subsequently would be phase
equilibria, liquids, solutions of non-electrolytes and electrolytes, and
chemical reaction equilibria. <br></p><p>Students
 who successfully complete the course will be able to predict how 
changes in molecular properties will influence the macroscopic behavior 
of those substances; they will understand the relationships between 
energy, heat, and work, and be able to predict how much work can be 
extracted from a given chemical process under various sets of 
conditions; they will understand the role of entropy in physical and 
chemical processes; and they will be able to engineer conditions to make
 chemical reactions spontaneously favorable (or not). Students will also
 become adept with differential calculus as a tool to derive and 
manipulate relationships between connected thermodynamic variables and 
state functions.<br></p>

Title:  Linear Circuits
Short desc:  Learn the analysis of circuits including resistors, capacitors, and inductors.  This course is directed towards people who are in science or engineering fields outside of the disciplines of electrical or computer engineering.  
Long desc:  This course is a first introduction to electrical systems. It includes
the analysis of circuits including resistors, capacitors, and inductors
with DC and AC sources in the time domain and in the frequency domain.
Laboratory demonstrations are given to reinforce the concepts learned from
the lectures and homework. The course is targeted at people with a scientific
or technical background who are not electrical or computer engineers. The
coverage is not as deep as a circuits course aimed at electrical engineers.
There are a number of physical applications demonstrated in this course
that serve to motivate this topic to a wider audience. The course is ideal

Title:  Game Theory II: Advanced Applications
Short desc:  This advanced course considers how to design interactions between agents in order to achieve good social outcomes. Three main topics are covered:  social choice theory (i.e., collective decision making), mechanism design, and auctions.
Long desc:  <div>

<p><span>Popularized by movies such as
"A Beautiful Mind", game theory is the mathematical modeling of
strategic interaction among rational (and irrational) agents.  Over four weeks of lectures, this <b>advanced</b> course considers how to design
interactions between agents in order to achieve good social outcomes. Three
main topics are covered:  social choice
theory (i.e., collective decision making), mechanism design, and auctions. </span></p>

</div>

<span>In the first week we consider the problem of
aggregating different agents' preferences, discussing voting rules and the
challenges faced in collective decision making. We present some of the most
important theoretical results in the area: notably, Arrow's Theorem, which
proves that there is no "perfect" voting system, and also the Gibbard-Satterthwaite
and Muller-Satterthwaite Theorems.  We
move on to consider the problem of making collective decisions when agents are
self interested and can strategically misreport their preferences. We explain
"mechanism design" -- a broad framework for designing interactions
between self-interested agents -- and give some key theoretical results. Our
third week focuses on the problem of designing mechanisms to maximize aggregate
happiness across agents, and presents the powerful family of
Vickrey-Clarke-Groves mechanisms.  The
course wraps up with a fourth week that considers the problem of allocating
scarce resources among self-interested agents, and that provides an
introduction to auction theory. </span>

Title:  Introduction to Communication Science
Short desc:  Since Antiquity, scholars have appreciated the importance of communication: as social beings, we cannot exist without communication. The course extends beyond the boundaries of communication science itself, exploring dimensions of history, sociology and psychology. Join our class, together with people all over the world.

Long desc:  <p>Since Antiquity,
scholars have appreciated the importance of communication: as social beings, we
cannot exist without communication. We need to interact with people around us,
to make sense of the world and to position ourselves in a wider social and
cultural reality. In this course, we look at how and why communication evolved
as a science and reflect on today’s dominant paradigms. The course also extends
beyond the boundaries of communication science itself, exploring dimensions of
history, sociology and psychology. Join our class, together with people all
over the world.</p>

Introduction to Communication Science explores some of the basic 
theories, models and concepts from the fields of mass, interpersonal and
 intrapersonal communication. The course begins with a consideration of 
several basic models, subsequently progressing to the history of 
communication theory, linear effect-oriented theories, the reception 
approach and, finally, exploring theories on the production and 
reinforcement of culture through communication. <br>
<br>
Upon completion of this course, students should:<br>
•	have a knowledge of the history and development of communication science; <br>
•	have a knowledge of the dominant theoretical approaches within communication science; <br>
•	have a knowledge and understanding of the most important models and concepts in this field. <br><br>

Title:  Assessment and Teaching of 21st Century Skills
Short desc:  Learn about ways to assess and teach new and emerging 21st century skills: we cover the nature of these skills, alternative methods of assessment, interpretation and reporting of assessments, and their implications for teaching.
Long desc:  Education and work are changing as a result of technology and its influence in the workplace. We now have new ways of working, new tools for working, new ways of living and even new ways of thinking as a result of the influence of technology on life, work and leisure.<br><br>In the workplace, more workers are needed in multi-tasking, information and communications-based employment. Entrants to workplaces need skills to function effectively in this environment that have not traditionally been taught in our schools and universities. In this course, we identify some of these complex skills, and select one to examine in detail - collaborative problem solving - that combines both cognitive and social aspects and requires the ability to use and build knowledge. It is widely regarded by industry as one of the skills lacking in young people and graduates as they struggle to secure stable employment. In some countries the unemployment rates of graduates exceeds 50%. The new skills - often erroneously called soft skills - are not being developed in schools or universities and in many cases when they are, there is uncertainty regarding how to assess and teach them.<br><br>In times of great change, when uncertainties dominate thinking about education and work, the result is often a paralysis in education and a reversion to rudimentary approaches to assessment that fail to inform directed learning and teaching. In this course we will focus on the nature of 21st century skills and their assessment, with a link to teaching styles and approaches suitable for a classroom in the 21st century.

Title:  Genomic and Precision Medicine
Short desc:  A critical, unbiased introduction to using new genomic tools for diagnosing and managing disease.
Long desc:  <p><span>Precision
medicine has the potential to change fundamentally how health care is
practiced, but requires a health care workforce that understands the
complexities of this field. One important component of Precision Medicine is
the use of an individual’s genomic information to offer targeted treatment,
tailored to the individual. Our course aims to provide
participants with some baseline knowledge of genomics, an overview of the clinical
applications of genomic medicine, the skills to evaluate the clinical validity
and utility of new tests, and an appreciation of the associated ethical and
social issues inherent in this field<span>.  </span></span></p>



<span>The
course is geared toward practicing health care providers, although it should be
accessible to anyone with a background in the biological sciences and a basic
understanding of genetics.  It is
designed to be succinct and clinically-focused, offering both conceptual and
practical information about real-world applications of genomics.  The first two lessons offer a basic primer on
molecular genomics relevant to the individual patient as well as to patient
populations. The remaining five lessons focus on five applications of genomics
and present the material as case studies, highlighting the strengths,
limitations, and issues that arise in the use of each test. </span><br><br><br><br>

Title:  Terrorism and Counterterrorism: Comparing Theory and Practice
Short desc:  Students, policy makers, journalists or anyone with a strong interest in terrorism and counter terrorism studies and trends will find the course most relevant. It will equip you with a range of insights that help you to analyze and understand these complex phenomena. 
Long desc:  <p>

</p>
<p>Terrorism has arguably been one of the defining factors of our age. It frequently makes headlines, threatening or attacking governments, private business and ordinary citizens. And in many parts of the world, it has been one of the most important threats
    to peace, security and stability. But what does this exactly mean? What is the nature of this threat? Who or what is threatened, how, by whom and why? What can be done about it or how can we at least limit the impact of terrorism and make sure that
    terrorists do not make headlines and manage to scare us?</p>
<p>These are just a handful of questions that will be addressd in this course that consists of three parts. First it focuses on the essence of terrorism as an instrument to achieve certain goals, in addition to an exploration of this phenomenon and the
    difficulties in defining it. The second part provides an overview of the state of the art in (counter) terrorism studies. Since ‘9/11’ terrorism studies have grown exponentially, reflecting the rise in perceived threats. But what has academia come
    up with? What theories, assumptions and conventional wisdom has it produced that could be of help in understanding terrorism and dealing with it? The most interesting results are examined and compared with empirical evidence with the aim to either
    stress their importance or to debunk them as myths. The final part looks into the implications and possibilities for policy making.</p><p><br></p>

        <br>Para seguir el curso es necesario tener conocimientos previos del sistema de numeración binario, de programación (ningún lenguaje en concreto, sólo el concepto de pseudo-código), y de las bases de la Electricidad/Electrónica (componentes, corrientes,
        tensiones, unidades, etc.). Habrá una "semana_0" en la que los estudiantes podrán realizar pruebas de autoevaluación para comprobar su nivel de conocimientos en estos temas.
        <br>Se trata de un curso muy adecuado para estudiantes de primeros cursos de carreras de Ingenierías cercanas a las TIC (Tecnologías de la Información y de las Comunicaciones), y para todas aquellas personas que deseen introducirse en el mundo de
        los Sistemas Digitales.
        <br>Por otra parte, este primer curso de Sistemas Digitales es un paso obligado para aquellas personas que deseen posteriormente profundizar en temas como el hardware de computadores y/o los circuitos integrados de aplicación específica, con todas
        las aplicaciones que ello implica (robótica, biónica, control industrial, etc.).
    </p>
    <p>Al acabar el curso el estudiante será capaz de:
        <br>
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Diseñar Sistemas Digitales de complejidad media.</li>

        <li>Describir y sintetizar Sistemas Digitales mediante lenguajes de descripción hardware de alto nivel.</li>

        <li>Comprender el funcionamiento de los computadores a su nivel más básico (lenguaje máquina), así como su materialización e interpretación a través de sistemas digitales algorítmicos.</li>
    </ul>

Title:  Linear and Discrete Optimization
Short desc:  The course is an introduction to linear and discrete optimization - an important part of computational mathematics with a wide range of applications in many areas of everyday life.
Long desc:  This
 course serves as an introduction to linear and discrete 
optimization from the viewpoint of a mathematician or computer 
scientist.  Besides learning how linear and discrete optimization can be applied, we focus on 
understanding methods that solve linear programs and discrete optimization problems in a mathematically 
rigorous way. <br><br>We will answer  questions like:<br><br><ul><li>Does a particular method work correctly?</li><li>Does it terminate and, if yes, in what time?</li><li>Can we prove that a solution is optimal?</li></ul>The
 course starts by discussing what a linear program is and how linear programming can be 
applied. Then, we will treat the simplex method and the theory of 
duality. We will then discuss some combinatorial optimization problems like maximum weight bipartite matching and maximum flows. <br><br>The
 course constitutes about half of the material on linear and discrete optimization 
that is taught for mathematics and computer science undergraduates at 
EPFL and will feature video lectures, quizzes, programming assignments, 
and a final exam. <br>

Title:  Introduction to Mathematical Thinking
Short desc:  Learn how to think the way mathematicians do - a powerful cognitive process developed over thousands of years.
Long desc:  <div><b><i>NOTE: For the Winter 2014 session, the course website will go live at 10:00 AM US-PST on Saturday February 1, two days before the course begins, so you have time to familiarize yourself with the website structure, watch some short introductory videos, and look at some preliminary material.<br><br></i></b>The goal of the course is to help you develop a valuable mental ability – a powerful way of thinking that our ancestors have developed over three thousand years.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Mathematical thinking is not the same as doing mathematics – at least not as mathematics is typically presented in our school system. School math typically focuses on learning procedures to solve highly stereotyped problems. Professional mathematicians think a certain way to solve real problems, problems that can arise from the everyday world, or from science, or from within mathematics itself. The key to success in school math is to learn to think inside-the-box. In contrast, a key feature of mathematical thinking is thinking outside-the-box – a valuable ability in today’s world. This course helps to develop that crucial way of thinking.</div>
<div> <br>The course is offered in two versions. The eight-week-long Basic Course is designed for people who want to develop or improve mathematics-based, analytic thinking for professional or general life purposes. The ten-week-long Extended Course is aimed primarily at first-year students at college or university who are thinking of majoring in mathematics or a mathematically-dependent subject, or high school seniors who have such a college career in mind. The final two weeks are more intensive and require more mathematical background than the Basic Course. There is no need to make a formal election between the two. Simply skip or drop out of the final two weeks if you decide you want to complete only the Basic Course.</div><div><br><b>Subtitles for all video lectures available in</b>: Portuguese (provided by <a href="http://www.fundacaolemann.org.br/" target="_blank">The Lemann Foundation</a>), English<br></div>

Title:  Introduction to Psychology as a Science
Short desc:  Learn about how psychology has developed a body of knowledge about behavior and mind through the use of scientific methods. All areas of psychology will be covered.
Long desc:  Since we were young children, we have tried to understand, to predict,
and to control behavior. We first dealt with our parents and teachers,
and later our friends and companions. This course shows, however,
how the understanding, prediction, and control of behavior require scientific
validation. By using tools that are systematic and objective, psychology
has learned how people behave and think.
<br>
<br>Psychology is a very broad field of study and the course will include
discussions of the brain and nervous system, sensation and perception,
learning, memory, intelligence and thinking, lifespan development, emotion
and motivation, personality, social behavior, behavioral disorders, and
psychological treatment of disorders. The course will include short
lecture modules, demonstrations and experiments, and writing assignments.

Short desc:  Analizar diferentes casos de estudio de usos educativos de las TIC y diseña un ambiente de aprendizaje que involucre herramientas digitales y tecnologías basadas en Internet. 
Long desc:  Las tecnologías de información y comunicación (TIC) han transformado la educación. Ello ocurre no sólo porque éstas han facilitado el desarrollo de algunas tareas que comúnmente realizábamos los profesores, los alumnos y los administradores sino porque también han abierto oportunidades para modificar tanto los ambientes de aprendizaje en los cuales se llevan a cabo los procesos educativos así como los métodos empleados para enseñar y aprender e incluso, cambiar los roles que anteriormente jugaba cada uno de los actores que intervenimos en el proceso educativo.<br><br> A lo largo de este curso analizaremos diferentes ambientes de aprendizaje y el papel que juegan las TIC en cada uno de ellos; reflexionando específicamente acerca de aquellos que podemos desarrollar nosotros mismos dados los contextos personales en los que nos encontramos.<br><br>El curso se imparte en español.<br><br><br><br>

Title:  Моделирование биологических молекул на GPU (Biomolecular modeling on GPU)
Short desc:  Моделирование биологических молекул - одна из бурно развивающихся областей современной науки. В курсе даются основы строения биомолекул, примеры применения программных пакетов для молекулярного моделирования, разъясняются подходы к математическому описанию молекулярных систем и разбирается программная реализация этих подходов на центральном и графическом процессорах.
Long desc:  <div><div>С развитием компьютерной техники, вычислительный эксперимент стал неотъемлемой частью любого научного исследования. На сегодняшний день, компьютеры помогают решать целый спектр различных задач - от гидродинамики до макроэкономики. В исследованиях биологических молекул, вычислительный эксперимент закрепился сравнительно недавно. Виной тому - сложность структуры биомолекул, которые могут насчитывать сотни, тысячи или даже десятки, сотни тысяч атомов. Под словом "моделирование" в названии курса подразумевается как раз вычислительный эксперимент. В начале XXI века, благодаря появлению новой высокопараллельной аппаратной платформы - графических процессоров, вычислительный эксперимент получил новый виток развития. Решение множества вычислительных задач - хорошо параллелизуемо. То есть, различные части расчёта можно производить одновременно. Одной из таких задач является молекулярное моделирование.</div><div><br></div><div>Цель данного курса - обеспечить понимание основных принципов молекулярного моделирования. В первой части пособия дан обзор строения различных биологических молекул - от последовательности до трёхмерной структуры. Далее разъяснены методы молекулярной механики и динамики, а также рассмотрены предпосылки использования различных подходов к моделированию. В качестве первого практического примера рассмотрена простая задача моделирования с применением общедоступного бесплатного пакета NAMD, разъяснены основы метода молекулярной динамики и использования программного пакета VMD для визуализации и анализа результатов. В последней части курса детально разобраны методы реализации численных методов молекулярного моделирования - как на центральном процессоре, так и на графическом. В курсе даётся вводная информация об устройстве ГП и его использовании для численных расчётов. Курс расчитан на студентов технических специальностей.</div><div><br></div><div>В рамках курса, слушатели узнают основы строения биологических молекул, научатся искать и визуализировать их структуры. Навыки использования готовых программных пакетов для биомолекулярного моделирования позволят наблюдать за динамикой каждого атома биомолекулы. Знания используемого в молекулярном моделировании математического формализма помогут лучше понимать возможности и ограничения молекулярного моделирования. Основы языка CUDA для программирования на графических процессорах будут закреплены программная реализация простой задачи молекулярного моделирования.</div><div><br></div><div>Данный курс будет интересен студентам технических специальностей, которые научатся применять уже имеющиеся у них знания в новой области. Студенты биолгических специальностей получат необходимые знания для применения вычислительного эксперимента в их деятельности.</div></div>

Title:  Archaeology's Dirty Little Secrets
Short desc:  Admit it — you wanted to be an archaeologist when you grew up...  This course builds on that enthusiasm, while radically expanding your notions about just what archaeology is and just what archaeologists do. 
Long desc:  <p>
















</p><p>
















</p><p>In this class, we will ask and answer a series of questions
about the role and practice of archaeology in the world today. If archaeologists
are trained to investigate the past, what is left for us to study?&nbsp; Who gets to be an archaeologist?&nbsp; How and why do archaeologists hunt for
“treasures”, and what do we do once we’ve discovered them?&nbsp; What can we know, and not know, about people
in the past? &nbsp;What do archaeologists know
about the past that most people would never guess – and why aren’t we telling
you?&nbsp; Why are people entirely willing to
murder each other over the fate of archaeological sites? &nbsp;Are Real Men alone capable of discovering the
truth behind all this?</p>

Archaeology famously involves getting dirty in
the line of duty.&nbsp; Students will
experience its hands-on nature, through the use of numerous exercises and archaeological
case studies.&nbsp; But there are other ‘dirty
little secrets’ to learn about the field: not least how the stories
archaeologists tell about the past have been used and abused, for purposes both
good and bad.&nbsp; Our goal by the end of the
course is to have you ‘thinking like an archaeologist’ and fully aware of the often-fraught
politics of doing archaeology around the globe.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br><p></p>

Title:  How Things Work 1
Short desc:  An introduction to physics in the context of everyday objects.
Long desc:  <div>Designed for non-science students, this course is a practical 
introduction to physics and science in everyday life. It considers 
objects from the world around us, identifying and exploring the 
scientific concepts upon which they're based. Because it starts with 
objects and looks within them for science, it is the reverse of a 
traditional physics class. Instead of the usual principle-driven physics
 class, How Things Work is case-study physics. In this pilot semester of
 How Things Work, we will explore the basic laws of motion in the 
context of six familiar objects or activities: (1) Skating, (2) Falling 
Balls, (3) Ramps, (4) Seesaws, (5) Wheels, and (6) Bumper Cars. Despite 
their simplicity, these topics will bring us in contact with some of the
 most important concepts in physics, including inertia, energy, and 
momentum.</div>

Title:  The Age of Sustainable Development
Short desc:  "The Age of Sustainable Development" gives students an understanding of the key challenges and pathways to sustainable development - that is, economic development that is also socially inclusive and environmentally sustainable.

NOTE: Course will launch at noon on January 21, 2014.
Long desc:  This course provides an introduction to the interdisciplinary field of sustainable development, drawing on the most recent developments in the social, policy, and physical sciences. Sustainable development is the most urgent challenge facing humanity. The fundamental question is how the world economy can continue to develop in a way that is socially inclusive and environmentally sustainable. The course describes the complex interactions between the world economy and the Earth's physical environment. Ecological processes and constraints (climate, disease ecology, physical resources such as soils and energy sources, topography and transport conditions) significantly shape the patterns of economic development, demography, and wealth and poverty. At the same time, human activities (farming, land use, urbanization, demographic change, and energy use) change the physical environments, increasingly in dangerous ways. The course offers a broad overview of the key challenges and potential solutions to achieve sustainable development in the 21st century. <br>

Title:  Health for All Through Primary Health Care
Short desc:  This course explores why primary health care is central for achieving Health for All. It provides examples of how primary health care has been instrumental in approaching this goal in selected populations and how the principles of primary health care can guide future policies and actions.
Long desc:  Two of the most inspiring, least understood, and most often derided terms
in global health discourse are “Health for All” and “Primary Health Care.”
In this course, we will explore these terms in the context of global health,
their origins and meanings, the principles upon which they rest, and examples
of how these principles have been implemented both at small scale as well
as at large scale. We will also explore some ultra-low-cost approaches
to Health for All through primary health care and the promise that primary
health care holds for eventually achieving Health for All.
<br>
<br>The course consists of six one-hour lectures with readings and opportunities
for discussions among those taking the course and interactions with the
professor.

Title:  The French Revolution
Short desc:  The French Revolution was one of the most important upheavals in world history. This course examines its origins, course and outcomes.


Long desc:  The French Revolution is one of the great turning-points in history.<br><br>In 1789 huge numbers of French peasants, urban workers and middle-class people successfully rebelled against absolute monarchy and the privileges of the nobility. But the struggle over what social and political system should replace the 'Old Regime' was to divide French people and finally the whole of Europe. This subject examines the history of the French Revolution from its origins to 1799.<br><br>The French Revolution continues to fascinate us, to inspire us, at times to horrify us. Never before had the people of a large and populous country sought to remake their society on the basis of the principles of liberty and equality. The drama, success and tragedy of their project has attracted students to it for more than two centuries. Its importance and fascination for us are undiminished as we try to understand revolutions in our own times.

Title:  Fantasy and Science Fiction: The Human Mind, Our Modern World
Short desc:  We understand the world — and our selves — through stories. Then some of those hopes and fears become the world.
Long desc:  Fantasy is a key term both in psychology and in the art and artifice of
humanity. The things we make, including our stories, reflect, serve, and
often shape our needs and desires. We see this everywhere from fairy tale
to kiddie lit to myth; from "Cinderella" to <i>Alice in Wonderland </i>to <i>Superman</i>;
from building a fort as a child to building ideal, planned cities as whole
societies. Fantasy in ways both entertaining and practical serves our persistent
needs and desires and illuminates the human mind. Fantasy expresses itself
in many ways, from the comfort we feel in the godlike powers of a fairy
godmother to the seductive unease we feel confronting Dracula. From a practical
viewpoint, of all the fictional forms that fantasy takes, science fiction,
from <i>Frankenstein</i> to <i>Avatar</i>, is the most important in our modern
world because it is the only kind that explicitly recognizes the profound
ways in which science and technology, those key products of the human mind,
shape not only our world but our very hopes and fears. This course will
explore Fantasy in general and Science Fiction in specific both as art
and as insights into ourselves and our world.

Title:  Internet History, Technology, and Security
Short desc:  What is the Internet? How was it created? How does it work?  How do we secure communications on the Internet?
Long desc:  The impact of technology and networks on our lives, culture, and society continues to increase. The very fact that you can take this course from anywhere in the world requires a technological infrastructure that was designed, engineered, and built over the past sixty years. To function in an information-centric world, we need to understand the workings of network technology. This course will open up the Internet and show you how it was created, who created it and how it works. Along the way we will meet many of the innovators who developed the Internet and Web technologies that we use today. <br><br>
<h2>What You Will Learn</h2>
After this course you will not take the Internet and Web for granted. You will be better informed about important technological issues currently facing society. You will realize that the Internet and Web are spaces for innovation and you will get a better understanding of how you might fit into that innovation. If you get excited about the material in this course, it is a great lead-in to taking a course in Web design, Web development, programming, or even network administration. At a minimum, you will be a much wiser network citizen.<br>

Title:  Model Thinking
Short desc:  In this class, you will learn how to think with models and use them to make sense of the complex world around us.
Long desc:  We live in a complex world with diverse people, firms, and governments whose behaviors aggregate to produce novel, unexpected phenomena. We see political uprisings, market crashes, and a never ending array of social trends. How do we make sense of it? Models. Evidence shows that people who think with models consistently outperform those who don't. And, moreover people who think with lots of models outperform people who use only one.
Why do models make us better thinkers?
Models help us to better organize information - to make sense of that fire hose or hairball of data (choose your metaphor) available on the Internet. Models improve our abilities to make accurate forecasts. They help us make better decisions and adopt more effective strategies. They even can improve our ability to design institutions and procedures. In this class, I present a starter kit of models: I start with models of tipping points. I move on to cover models explain the wisdom of crowds, models that show why some countries are rich and some are poor, and models that help unpack the strategic decisions of firm and politicians. The models covered in this class provide a foundation for future social science classes, whether they be in economics, political science, business, or sociology. Mastering this material will give you a huge leg up in advanced courses. They also help you in life.
Here's how the course will work.
For each model, I present a short, easily digestible overview lecture. Then, I'll dig deeper. I'll go into the technical details of the model. Those technical lectures won't require calculus but be prepared for some algebra. For all the lectures, I'll offer some questions and we'll have quizzes and even a final exam. If you decide to do the deep dive, and take all the quizzes and the exam, you'll receive a certificate of completion. If you just decide to follow along for the introductory lectures to gain some exposure that's fine too. It's all free. And it's all here to help make you a better thinker!<br><br><b>Subtitles for</b>&nbsp;<b>all video lectures available in</b>:&nbsp;Chinese (provided by&nbsp;<a href="http://coursera.yeeyan.org/" target="_blank">Yeeyan</a>),&nbsp;English,&nbsp;Ukrainian (<a href="http://pinchukfund.org/en/">Pinchuk Foundation</a>)<br>

guest experts, and material intended to delight psychology lovers around the world. </p>

<p><b>Course Description from
Professor Plous:</b></p>

<p>Each of us is dealt a different hand in life, but we all face similar
questions when it comes to human behavior: What leads us to like one
person and dislike another? How do conflicts and prejudices develop, and
how can they be reduced? Can psychological research help protect the environment,
and if so, how? This course offers an introduction to classic and contemporary
social psychology, covering topics such as decision making, persuasion,
group behavior, personal attraction, and factors that promote health and
well-being.</p><p>Our focus will be on surprising, entertaining, and intriguing research
findings that are easy to apply in daily life. As part of this focus, several
homework assignments will encourage you to experiment with your life, observe
the results, and analyze what took place. The course will also draw from
the web sites of <a href="http://www.socialpsychology.org/" title="Link: http://www.socialpsychology.org/">Social Psychology Network</a>,
the world's largest online community devoted to social psychology. I hope
you'll join me for this course, have fun, and learn some useful information
that enriches your life!    </p>

Title:  Networks: Friends, Money, and Bytes
Short desc:  A course driven by 20 practical questions about wireless, web, and the Internet, about how products from companies like Apple, Google, Facebook, Netflix, Amazon, Ericsson, HP, Skype and AT&T work.

In this offering, we will cover 7 of the 20 questions, and you will have the opportunity to personalize your own learning experience by choosing which of the versions suits you best.
Long desc:  You pick up your iPhone while waiting in line at a coffee shop. You google a not-so-famous actor, get linked to a Wikipedia entry listing his recent movies and popular YouTube clips of several of them. You check out user reviews on Amazon and pick one,
download that movie on BitTorrent or stream that in Netflix. But suddenly the WiFi logo on your phone is gone and you're on 3G. Video quality starts to degrade, but you don't know if it's the server getting crowded or the Internet is congested somewhere.
In any case, it costs you $10 per Gigabyte, and you decide to stop watching the movie, and instead multitask between sending tweets and calling your friend on Skype, while songs stream from iCloud to your phone. You're happy with the call quality, but
get a little irritated when you see there're no new followers on Twitter. You may wonder how they all kind of work, and why sometimes they don't. Take a look at the list of 20 questions below. Each question is selected not just for its relevance to our
daily lives, but also for the core concepts in the field of networking illustrated by its answers. This course is about formulating and answering some of these 20 questions.

Title:  Calculus One
Short desc:  Calculus One is a first introduction to differential and integral calculus, emphasizing engaging examples from everyday life.
Long desc:  Calculus is about the very large, the very small, and how things change.  The surprise is that something seemingly so abstract ends up explaining the real world.  Calculus plays a starring role in the biological, physical, and social sciences.  By focusing outside of the classroom, we will see examples of calculus appearing in daily life.<br><br>This course is a first and friendly introduction to calculus, suitable for someone who has never seen the subject before, or for someone who has seen some calculus but wants to review the concepts and practice applying those concepts to solve problems.  One learns calculus by doing calculus, and so this course encourages you to participate by providing you with:<br><br><ul><li>instant feedback on practice problems</li><li>interactive graphs and games for you to play</li><li>calculus projects and demos you can try at home</li><li>opportunities for you to explain your thought process</li></ul>

Title:  Corrección y Estilo en Español
Short desc:  En este curso, con una consideración policéntrica de la lengua, se pretende activar o potenciar el interés por la corrección de los textos propios y ajenos.
Long desc:  En este curso, desde el examen, estudio y argumentación de posibles errores, o aciertos, de expresión, vamos a activar o potenciar el interés por las formas preferibles y la atención ante las expresiones consideradas erróneas o impropias en cualquier
norma del español actual. <span>
  <p>También nos ocuparemos en el análisis y argumentación de
  diferencias de ESTILO: entre dos formas de decir alternativas, ¿cuál es
  preferible y por qué? La finalidad de esta parte es potenciar la preocupación
  por las alternativas de expresión. </p>
  <p><span>NO es un curso de <b>redacción</b>
  en español. NO es un curso de <b>edición</b>
  en español. NO es un curso de <b>traducción</b>
  en español. Pero el curso puede ser de gran provecho en labores de redacción

</div>

<span>
<p><span>Se tomarán como referencia las variantes del español de América y de España. Las propuestas y consideraciones, de corrección o de estilo, se van a fundar, siempre que sea posible, en los datos de uso de todas las variantes del español, compilados en el <i>Corpus de Referencia del Español Actual</i>, CREA, y en el <i>Corpus Diacrónico del Español</i>, CORDE, o el CORPES XXI, <i>Corpus del Español del Siglo XXI</i>.<br></span>
</p>
<p><span>La <b>finalidad</b> del curso es doble.
  Primero, ante un texto ajeno suscitar el interés sobre 1º, lo que se dice; y
  2º, cómo se diría, mejor: con más claridad, con más precisión, con más
  propiedad, con un ‘estilo’ de más calidad argumentada lingüísticamente. Y,
  ante un texto propio, suscitar la preocupación sobre cómo decir mejor lo que
  se pretende: con más claridad, de manera unívoca; con más precisión; con
  gusto más general y sancionado; con ‘estilo’ de mejor consideración.</span>
</p>
<p><span>El
  curso tiene dos <b>objetivos</b>: 1º,
  identificar y argumentar las posibles incorrecciones de expresión en textos
  de autores españoles o en textos de versión en español de otras lenguas; y
  2º, estudiar y evaluar las alternativas y variaciones (¿de estilo?) entre dos
  versiones españolas actuales de <i>Los
  amigos de Eddie Coyle,</i> de G. V. Higgins (1973 [<i>El Chivato</i>] vs. 2011), y de J. D. Salinger (<i>El guardián entre el centeno, </i>1978 vs. 2007). Este segundo objeto
  de estudio tiene más valor porque los textos de observación cumplen, sin
  duda, una condición esencial en el análisis y evaluación lingüísticos: la
  condición de la ‘paráfrasis’: real (con diferencias de estilo) o pretendida
  (con quiebras o errores), entre ambas versiones, que dicen, o pretenden decir
  lo mismo que en el texto fuente.</span>
</p>
<p><span>Los <b>destinatarios</b>
  de este curso son, p</span>rimero, estudiantes de Lengua Española, o de Español Lengua Extranjera (E/LE) de niveles C1 o C2; estudiantes de diferentes Filologías, de Traducción, de Comunicación, de Educación, de Edición y Producción editorial, de Humanidades,
    o de otras especialidades donde el dominio de la expresión con corrección y estilo es una nota de calidad en la propia preparación.</p>
<p>Por los “beneficios”, las personas que completen el curso,</p>
<ul>
    <li>Pueden mejorar sustancialmente sus cualidades expresivas y de dominio de la lengua.</li>
    <li>Activarán su preocupación en la satisfacción de las condiciones de corrección y estilo de la lengua, las habilidades expresivas y de comprensión y corrección:</li>
    <ul>
        <li>en textos creativos,</li>
        <li>en textos de proyectos, exposiciones o de informes.</li>
        <li>en la redacción de instrucciones de uso o prospectos comunes.

Title:  An Introduction to Operations Management
Short desc:  This course will teach you how to analyze and improve business processes, be it in services or in manufacturing. You will learn how to improve productivity, how to provide more choice to customers, how to reduce response times, and how to improve quality.
Long desc:  <p><b>PART OF THE WHARTON FOUNDATION SERIES</b>&nbsp;
</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Remember the last time you went to a restaurant. What did you expect from that restaurant? You wanted to find something on the menu that you liked, you wanted the meal to be prepared according to high quality standards, you wanted to get it quickly and
    didn’t want to pay too much money for it. Now, remember the last time you went to a doctor’s office or a hospital. What did you want the doctors and nurses to do? You wanted them to provide the right care for you, you wanted the care delivered with
    great quality, you wanted to get the care quickly, and you (or your insurance) didn’t want to pay too much for it.
    <br>
    <br>Put differently, the management skills that you need to run the operations of a restaurant are the same that you need to run a hospital. And these are the skills you will learn in this course. Specifically, you will learn how to improve productivity,
    increase responsiveness, provide more choice to the customer, and deliver higher quality standards. In short, you will learn how to analyze business processes and how to improve them. Along the way, you will learn about topics such as Lean Operations,
    Six Sigma, and the Toyota production system, you will hear about bottlenecks, flows rates, and inventory levels. And, much, much more.</p>

Title:  How Viruses Cause Disease
Short desc:  Introductory virology course that covers the interplay between viruses and their host organisms, with with the goal of understanding viral diseases and their prevention.
Long desc:  This introductory virology course explores the interplay between viruses and their host organisms. The course begins with an overview of how infection is established in a host, then moves to a virologist's view of immune defenses.  Next we consider how the replication strategy and the host response determine the outcome of infection, such that some are short and others are of long duration. The mechanisms by which virus infections transform cells in culture are explored, a process that may lead to tumor formation in animals. We then move to a discussion of how viral infections are controlled by vaccines and antiviral drugs. After an introduction to viral evolution, we discuss the principles learned from zoonotic infections, emerging infections, and humankind's experiences with epidemic and pandemic viral infections. The course ends with an exploration of unusual infectious agents such as viroids, satellites, and prions, followed by a discussion of the causative agent of the most serious current worldwide epidemic, HIV-1.

Short desc:  	本課程之教學內容以希臘哲學之發展為主，並輔以哲學對人生意義之說明。希臘哲學是西洋哲學的骨幹，呈現西方人思維的核心理念，不但足以解釋今日之西方世界，甚至可以說明全世界的發展趨勢。本課程以希臘哲學為教學之主幹，分為先蘇哲學、詭辯學派、蘇格拉底、柏拉圖、亞理斯多德五個階段。教學的方式以強調他們之間的不同與相同的部分。課程將以演講的方式進行，揉合日常經驗作說明，並不時地會以整體的角度回頭看希臘哲學在今日哲學與社會所扮演的角色。

Long desc:  <p>本課程企圖達到下列三項目標：</p><p><br></p><p>第一，西學中講。所有的哲學思想有其核心結構可以沿用到世界各個角落。在應用哲學的過程中，最重要的事情是用自己的語言「重新脈絡化」哲學思想的源起、發展以及展望。本課程第一目標即「西學中講」，讓希臘哲學的精意能夠顯現在我們日常生活之中。</p><p><br></p><p>第二，挑戰主題。希臘哲學有其深沉脈絡，因此自然有它所特別著重的議題。在這些議題中，例如對政治的批判、對性向的寬容、對社會不平等的理解，甚至對經濟特權的強調，都是存在於當今社會中忌諱議題。希臘哲學的講述中，連帶地會說明這些議題會生成的條件，有助於我們從哲學的觀點理解平日社會中比較少觸及的議題。</p><p><br></p><p>第三，本課程最重要的目標，就是掌握希臘哲學的發展脈絡，使課程內容成為我們生活導引的價值。這些價值的體會與應用有助於我們看清社會發展的動態，能夠應用於生活之中。</p>

Short desc:  Entender las metodologías para la innovación de productos para mercados emergentes.  Las metodologías son:  1) megatendencias sociales, tecnológicas y del comportamiento del consumidor 2) JTBD y 3) Matriz Morfológica.
Long desc:  <p>El objetivo del curso es aprender el proceso para el
Desarrollo Rápido de Productos Innovadores para mercados emergentes a través de la
aplicación de 3 metodologías.  Las
metodologías que abordaremos en el curso son: </p>

<p> <b><span>1) Megatendencias sociales,
tecnologías y del comportamiento del consumidor: <br></span></b>Las megatendencias sociales describen
comportamientos de la sociedad y hábitos de consumo. Las megatendencias
tecnológicas identifican el uso potencial de tecnologías para desarrollar
productos. Finalmente, la megatendencias del comportamiento del consumidor
describen características funcionales de productos que son deseables por el
cliente.  <b><br></b></p>

<p><b>2) Jobs To Be
Done (JTBD):<br></b><b> </b>Jobs To Be Done (JTBD) es un conjunto de técnicas que permiten describir las actividades
de los consumidores, sus hábitos en el uso de productos y la evaluación de cada
actividad en términos de su carácter crítico en una matriz de necesidades y
satisfactores.  Esto permite identificar
aquellas actividades en donde el desarrollo productos innovadores tiene más
probabilidades de éxito. </p>



<p><b><span>3) Matriz Morfológica: <br></span></b>La última metodología es la matriz morfológica que
permite evaluar opciones de tecnologías para desarrollar los productos
conceptualizados por las técnicas anteriores. </p>

Title:  El ABC del emprendimiento esbelto 
Short desc:  A través de diferentes actividades de campo el participante vive personalmente el proceso emprendedor, aprendiendo los conceptos del curso principalmente con base en la experimentación. 
Long desc:  <p>A pesar de que una gran parte de la literatura sobre emprendimiento prepara
    al “candidato emprendedor” a cómo hacer planes de negocio para conseguir
    financiamiento proveniente de supuestos inversionistas, tal y como lo hace
    la tradición norteamericana de enseñanza del emprendimiento, la realidad
    de negocios nos dice que inclusive en los países desarrollados los proyectos
    emprendedores inician con sus recursos financieros propios y normalmente
    muy escasos.</p>La principal herramienta para estos emprendimientos no
es el plan de negocios ni el financiamiento, sino la creatividad empresarial. 
Por lo que, para una enseñanza efectiva del proceso emprendedor, hay que
partir de esta realidad y no solo imitar lo que sucede en universidades,
principalmente norteamericanas, con un contexto muy diferente al resto
del mundo. Por otro lado, pareciera un misterio el por qué solo muy pocos
proyectos de empresa o de negocio tienen éxito, pareciera una combinación
entre el “culto” a la personalidad del emprendedor y suerte; sin embargo
la realidad nos demuestra que los proceso emprendedores que tienen éxito,
si bien tiene una influencia la importante motivación y la persona, siguen
un proceso con etapas específicas, un patrón de acciones muy similar, aunque
los emprendedores no se hayan dado cuenta de este proceso.
<br>
<br>
<p>Este curso invita al participante a tener la persistencia para seguir
    este proceso emprendedor basado en la experimentación.</p>

Title:  Beyond Silicon Valley: Growing Entrepreneurship in Transitioning Economies
Short desc:  Explore how communities in transitioning economies around the world are working to enable the growth of entrepreneurship when the resources from the private sector alone are limited.
Long desc:  The path for entrepreneurs to grow their companies outside of well-developed entrepreneurial ecosystems like Silicon Valley is challenging. Most markets around the world do not look like Silicon Valley, and they never will. But there are other models
to support new businesses. In transitioning markets (where entrepreneurs do not have much access to private sector financing), government officials, donors, and business leaders are experimenting with creative approaches to support the growth of entrepreneurs.
Northeast Ohio, whose largest city is Cleveland, is one such community. During our time together in this course, we will be exploring some of these innovative approaches.
<br>
<br>A massive intervention of government and donor resources in Northeast Ohio has been in place for over ten years. In that time, Northeast Ohio has experienced success (including job creation and follow-on funding) with alternative methods of financing
startups, but it has not been easy. Yes, some progress has been made, but whether or not they've hit on ultimate success has yet to be determined. A dynamic entrepreneurial ecosystem takes many years, even decades, to develop. Government officials
and donors typically are looking for shorter term success with their support programs which makes long-term support for entrepreneurship challenging.
<br>
<br>During this course, we will hear from entrepreneurs who have launched products and services ranging from medical devices to LED lights to whiskey. You will learn how these entrepreneurs engaged with resources made available to them through a variety of
programs and intermediary organizations. We have chosen to talk with many business people that are still in the process of developing their companies and whose ultimate success or failure is still to be determined.
<br>
<br>One of our goals is to learn from you how different communities around the world are approaching implementing strategies and methods to support businesses. Taking what we've learned from our examples in class, I will ask you to reflect on how to
best grow entrepreneurship where you live. I am excited to use this global platform to create a dialogue where information flows in multiple directions.
<br>
<br>Most MOOCs rebroadcast professors’ lectures, but this course will be different. Don’t expect to see me standing in front of the camera, talking and lecturing every week. Instead, the lectures will be relatively short in length (8-10 minutes) and
will have more of the feel of an engaging documentary than a static classroom setting. We will also be providing you with opportunities for live engagement with the featured entrepreneurs and thought leaders through a number of interactive sessions during the course.

Title:  Introduction aux droits de l’homme
Short desc:  Ce cours propose une introduction à la protection internationale des droits de l’homme. Il en présente les sources, les catégories, le contenu et les limites qui leur sont opposables, ainsi que les obligations qu’ils génèrent à la charge des Etats. Il expose aussi les principaux mécanismes de mise en œuvre prévus au niveau universel et régional pour assurer leur respect.
Long desc:  Depuis la fin de la Seconde Guerre mondiale, les
      droits de l’homme sont un domaine en plein essor. De nombreuses causes
      sont aujourd’hui défendues et débattues sous la bannière des droits de
      l’homme&nbsp;: la protection des minorités, la lutte contre la
      discrimination des femmes, des personnes lesbiennes, gaies, bisexuelles
      et transgenres (LGBT), la lutte contre la torture et les disparitions
      forcées, la lutte contre la pauvreté ou encore la protection de
      l’environnement et la protection des données. Partout dans le monde, ces
      causes mobilisent tant les acteurs politiques que la société civile et elles sont
      discutées dans de multiples enceintes, nationales et internationales.<br><br>Le présent cours vise à offrir les bases nécessaires
      pour appréhender et comprendre le domaine vaste et complexe que sont
      devenus les droits de l’homme. Quelles sont les caractéristiques et les
      différentes catégorie des droits de l’homme&nbsp;? Quels sont leurs fondements
      philosophiques et historiques ? Pourquoi ces droits sont-ils
      importants&nbsp;? Quels instruments visent à les protéger ? Comment
      rendre ces droits opérationnels&nbsp;? Quels mécanismes existent pour les
      mettre en œuvre et quels sont leurs avantages et leurs
      inconvénients&nbsp;?<br><br>En abordant ces questions, le cours s’adresse tant à
      des membres de la communauté universitaire qu’à des praticiens
      (responsables politiques, membres du corps diplomatique, fonctionnaires,
      journalistes, membres d’ONG, défenseurs des droits de l’homme et
      spécialistes de la coopération au développement, de l’aide humanitaire et
      des questions relatives aux réfugiés), ainsi qu’à toutes les personnes
      qui sont engagées dans la protection des droits de l’homme ou simplement
      désireuses de mieux comprendre ce phénomène.<br><br>Le cours est conçu et dispensé par les Professeurs
      Maya Hertig Randall et Michel Hottelier, de la Faculté de droit de
      l’Université de Genève. Durant le cours, des membres d’organes et
      institutions voués à la protection des droits de l’homme et des
      spécialistes de la communauté académique seront invités à intervenir.

Title:  Common Core in Action: Literacy Across Content Areas
Short desc:  Learn how to apply some of the tools from the Literacy Design Collaborative to incorporate Common Core literacy standards into your content area. In this course you will explore Literacy Design Collaborative Resources, create a teaching task, and develop a plan to use the task within classroom instruction.
Long desc:  The Common Core State Standards are new and will challenge our students to show evidence of learning in new ways.  Instructional shifts are required, especially for teachers who must now incorporate literacy into content areas. Integrating the literacy standards can be difficult to do well. In this course you will have the support of a community and harness the power of collaboratively exchanging ideas with colleagues, as you design a teaching task (writing prompt) aligned with the Common Core.<br> <br>You will use a template from the Literacy Design Collaborative (LDC) to design a task that incorporates literacy into your content area and then create a brief plan for its use. These template tasks are a part of a much more in-depth LDC Module design and will serve to introduce you to the model and process.   <br><br>

Title:  史記（一）（Shi-ji (1) ）
Short desc:  人文學，其特色在於「慢熱」，需要耐心細嚐、咀嚼古聖先賢的智慧結晶與其文字背後所隱含的真正意義。史記系列課程將透過對《史記》一書的導讀，引領同學們探究史學之「真」與「善」。 

不管你是對中華文化感興趣者、想更深入了解傳統史學者、喜歡論理分析者、或是久仰太史公司馬遷之名之愛好者，這門課一定會讓你收穫良多。因為《史記》不僅記載了無數精彩非凡的歷史人事，更貫串了在它之前的多數古代典籍，可說是集中國上古文明精粹於一書。更重要的是，這門課程中將引導大家如何讀《史記》，進而學會如何讀中國史書、如何讀中國書。

這是一場史學的思辨之旅，希望各位同學千萬不要錯過！

Long desc:  《史記》不僅為中國之史學經典名著，同時還兼有經、史、子、集四部之特質，乃中國文化中最可寶貴之一大遺產。其縱述自軒轅迄漢武兩千年事，原始察終，見盛 觀衰，非僅一代良史，明為百王大法。太史公自詡此書「究天人之際，通古今之變，成一家之言」，以雄深雅健之文字，發揮其獨特之思想，故後人譽之為「史家之絕唱」。研讀此書者，亦當以讀大著作之心為之，好學深思以探究史公之作意，始能真有所獲。

Title:  Better Leader, Richer Life
Short desc:  The Total Leadership approach will help you become a better leader by having a richer life and have a richer life by becoming a better leader.  Learn a practical, proven method for how to articulate your core values and vision; build trust with your most important people; and achieve "four-way wins" -- improved performance at work or in school, at home with your family, in your community, and for your self (mind, body, spirit).  It's not about "work/life balance"; it's about creating harmony among the different parts of your life as a leader in all of them. 
Long desc:  <p><span>Life is a zero-sum game,
right?  The more you strive to win in one
dimension (such as your work or school), the more you have to sacrifice in the
other dimensions (family, community, and the private self).  Described in the best-selling, award-winning
book <i><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Total-Leadership-Better-Leader-Richer/dp/1422103285/ref=tmm_hrd_title_0?ie=UTF8&qid=1384022569&sr=8-1" target="_blank" title="Link: http://www.amazon.com/Total-Leadership-Better-Leader-Richer/dp/1422103285/ref=tmm_hrd_title_0?ie=UTF8&qid=1384022569&sr=8-1">Total Leadership: Be a Better
Leader, Have a Richer Life</a></i> (Harvard Business, 2008), this course teaches you a proven
method that shows how you don’t always have to make trade-offs between life’s
most important domains, and certainly not as often as you think.  Nor should you!  A trade-off mindset makes people feel all
manner of stress – unfocused, resentful, and overwhelmed.  It hurts those you care about and prevents you
from performing effectively to produce results that matter in every part of your
life. </span>
</p>

<p>This practical course has been taught to thousands of students at Wharton and elsewhere by professor Stew Friedman since 2001.  You will learn how to articulate your values and personal leadership vision, cultivate supportive relationships with people
    who matter most in all parts of your life, and continually experiment with how you get things done to better align your actions with your values -- and so produce positive sustainable change.  This step-by-step method for pursuing what Friedman calls "four-way wins" has enabled people all over the world to become more successful and satisfied leaders in all parts of life: work (or school), home, community, and the private self (mind, body, and spirit).

Title:  Disaster Preparedness
Short desc:  During this course, students will gain an understanding of the Disaster Cycle, concentrating on the Mitigation Phase. They will examine disaster planning on a personal level developing a disaster plan and examine Awareness and Attitude during disasters and daily life.
Long desc:  This course will teach the student how to survive when everything we normally
take for granted is gone, when the structures we depend on have failed.
We will examine the Disaster Cycle, particularly the Mitigation and Recovery
phases. Students will prepare an extensive personal preparedness plan covering
such topics as supplies, communication, food and water, shelter, security,
and comfort (yes even in survival there can and should be comfort). We
also look at preparedness on the institutional and government levels.
<br>
<br>We will look beyond these plans towards the one aspect of survival, which
will enable a person to survive when all planning has failed. Disasters,
by definition, overwhelm all available resources. If all available resources
are gone, only one thing will keep a person alive and that is their attitude.
A persons awareness and attitude, the two are closely linked, allow a person
the means to remain calm, avoid panic, and draw upon resources within and
outside the person to survive when their world has failed. In truth not
everyone survives in extreme circumstances; people die, but, even in death,
attitude, if it cannot save you, provides some degree or comfort.

Title:  Animal Behaviour
Short desc:  This course will help you understand the remarkable behaviors of wild animals from an evolutionary perspective.

Long desc:  <p>Many of us derive inspiration from watching natural history
documentaries and their astounding catalogue of wild animal behaviours.  In this course, we will explore how
scientists study animal behaviour, and in particular how behaviour is shaped by the evolutionary forces of natural and sexual
selection. Topics include resource acquisition; avoiding enemies; mate choice and sexual conflict; cues, signals and communication; parental care and social behaviour; and
the role of genes, environments and learning in regulating behavioural diversity.  We
draw on examples from across the animal kingdom to illustrate the complex
mechanisms underlying adaptations, and complement these with natural
history videos that highlight key concepts. We evaluate the scientific rigour
of studies used to test theory, and highlight the often ingenious methods
adopted by researchers to understand animal behaviour.</p>

Title:  Generating the Wealth of Nations
Short desc:  A survey of the history of economic development in the world in the past 300 years.
Long desc:  <p>If
you had been alive at the start of the eighteenth century, your material
well-being would have been much the same whichever region of the world you
lived in, and it would almost certainly have been a precarious existence.  Go back 300 years before the eighteenth
century, and not much was different.  But
come forward 300 years to the present, and we see a startling transformation. </p>

<p>Incomes
in some parts of the world have increased more than ten-fold; and now it most
certainly does matter where you live – with income differentials of 50 times
between the world’s richest and poorest countries.  What has changed in the past 300 years is the
development and application of new technologies at a pace unprecedented in
human history – the steam engine, electricity and the computer, to name just a
few.  With these developments, for those
who have access to them, have come huge gains in living standards.</p>

<p>In
this course we’ll explore the spectacular (but uneven) story of economic
development – beginning with the Malthusian era, moving on to the take-off of
growth in the Industrial Revolution and the Great Divergence in living
standards that followed, and finishing in the present with the Global Financial
Crisis.  We’ll cover the main episodes
and events in the development of the world economy in the past 300 years, and
have something to say about most regions of the world.  As well as dealing with ‘what happened’, the
course will emphasise what is known about ‘why’ – and what lessons historical
experience can provide for understanding how some countries today are so rich
yet others remain so poor.</p><p>Course image: Copyright JL Brown. Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported (CC BY 3.0) <br></p><br>

Title:  Exploring Quantum Physics
Short desc:  An introduction to quantum physics with emphasis on topics at the frontiers of research, and developing understanding through exercise.
Long desc:  <p>Quantum
physics is the foundation for much of modern technology, provides the framework
for understanding light and matter from the subatomic to macroscopic domains,
and makes possible the most precise measurements ever made.&nbsp; More than just a theory, it offers a way of
looking at the world that grows richer with experience and practice.&nbsp; Our course will provide some of that practice and teach 
you "tricks of the trade" (not found in textbooks) that will enable you 
to solve quantum-mechanical problems yourself and understand the subject
 at a deeper level.</p>

<p>The
basic principles of quantum physics are actually quite simple, but they lead to
astonishing outcomes. &nbsp;Two examples that
we will look at from various perspectives are the prediction of the laser by
Albert Einstein in 1917 and the prediction of antimatter by Paul Dirac in 1928.&nbsp; Both of these predictions came from very
simple arguments in quantum theory, and led to results that transformed science
and society.&nbsp; Another familiar
phenomenon, magnetism, had been known since antiquity, but only with the advent
of quantum physics was it understood how magnets worked, to a degree that made
possible the discovery in the 1980’s of ultrastrong rare-earth magnets.&nbsp; However, lasers, antimatter and magnets are
areas of vibrant research, and they are all encountered in the new field of
ultracold atomic physics that will provide much of the material of “Exploring
Quantum Physics”.</p>

<p>Richard
Feynman once said, “I think I can safely say that nobody understands quantum
mechanics.”&nbsp; We say, that’s no reason not
to try! What Feynman was referring to are some of the “spooky” phenomena like quantum entanglement, which are incomprehensible from the standpoint of classical physics. Even though they have been thoroughly tested by experiment, and are even being exploited for applications such as cryptography and logic processing, they still seem so counterintuitive that they give rise to extraordinary ideas such as the many-world theory. Quantum physics combines
a spectacular record of discovery and predictive success, with foundational
perplexities so severe that even Albert Einstein came to believe that it was
wrong.&nbsp; This is what makes it such an
exciting area of science!</p><br>

Title:  Marriage and the Movies: A History
Short desc:  The topic of marriage in the movies has always provided a fascinating reflection of changing social attitudes, shifting morals and gender roles. We will explore how films have defined marriage, identified seven core problems, and varied its three narrative components -- a couple, their problems, their situation -- from decade to decade from the silent to the modern era.
Long desc:  From the beginning of motion picture history, marriage has been a topic for popular story-telling, but Hollywood struggled with a subject that presented problems an audience already knew and perhaps did not want to see as entertainment.
<br>
<br>How the film-making business crafted tales that were simultaneously an "I do!" of happiness and an "I don't!" of disappointment is a fascinating reflection of America's history, changing social attitudes, shifting morals and gender roles. Hollywood found
ways both to reflect reality and deflect misery as decade after decade, movies adjusted a basic formula to audience needs.
<br>
<br>Film clips and still photographs will illustrate how films defined marriage in the movies, identified a core seven problems, and varied its three narrative components -- a couple, their problems, their situation -- from decade to decade from the silent
to the modern era.

Title:  Linear Circuits
Short desc:  Learn the analysis of circuits including resistors, capacitors, and inductors.  This course is directed towards people who are in science or engineering fields outside of the disciplines of electrical or computer engineering.  
Long desc:  This course is a first introduction to electrical systems. It includes
the analysis of circuits including resistors, capacitors, and inductors
with DC and AC sources in the time domain and in the frequency domain.
Laboratory demonstrations are given to reinforce the concepts learned from
the lectures and homework. The course is targeted at people with a scientific
or technical background who are not electrical or computer engineers. The
coverage is not as deep as a circuits course aimed at electrical engineers.
There are a number of physical applications demonstrated in this course
that serve to motivate this topic to a wider audience. The course is ideal
for someone who wants to gain a basic understanding of electrical circuits,
someone who wants to get better intuition for what they have already learned,
precocious hobbyists, or for someone who is considering electrical engineering
as a career.

Title:  Principles of Microeconomics
Short desc:  Learn how markets work, what they accomplish well and what their limitations are.
Long desc:  <p>
	
	
	


</p><p>We make economics
decisions every day: what to buy, whether to work or play, what to
study. We respond to markets all the time: prices influence our
decisions, markets signal where to put effort, they direct firms to
produce certain goods over others. Economics is all around us. </p><p>This
course is a rigorous introduction to the microeconomic theory of
markets: why we have them, how they work, what they accomplish. We
will explore what outcomes they generate when they work well
and what happens when they do not. We will learn why governments are
important and when regulation and intervention is necessary. Examples
are taken from everyday life, from goods and services that we all
purchase and use. We will apply the theory to current events and
policy debates through weekly exercises. These will empower you to be
an educated, critical thinker who can understand, analyze and
evaluate market outcomes.

Title:  Creative Problem Solving
Short desc:  This course deals directly with your ability for creativity which is a critical skill in any field. It focuses on divergent thinking, the ability to develop multiple ideas and concepts to solve problems. Through a series of creativity building exercises, short lectures, and readings, learners develop both an understanding of creativity and increase their own ability. 
Long desc:  This course will help you understand the role of creativity, innovation, and problem solving in your own life and across disciplines. It will challenge you to move outside of your existing comfort zone and to recognize the value of that exploration. What makes an idea creative, anyway? This course will help you understand the importance of diverse ideas, and to convey that understanding to others. It will cover methods for generating new ideas, increasing motivation, and ways to increase your own creative ability through assessment and discussion. <br><br>The principal learning activity in the course is a series of "differents" where you will be challenged to identify and change your own cultural, habitual, and normal patterns of behavior. Creative prompts such as "eat something different" and "do something as a child" will encourage you to recognize your limits and overcome them. In addition, you are encouraged to understand that creativity is based on societal norms, and that by its nature, it will differ from and be discouraged by society; in this course, the persistence of the creative person is developed through practice. You will learn how to approach problems in divergent ways and apply this knowledge to your daily endeavors.

Title:  Introductory Physics I with Laboratory
Short desc:  Explore motion in the real world using modern tools and techniques (video capture and analysis, computer modeling) guided by fundamental physics principles.
Long desc:  <div>
    <p>We will investigate motion in the world around us; we welcome both those
        who want to participate fully and those who wish to sample, cafeteria-style,
        the activities of this course. &nbsp;Those who participate fully will experience
        a course that is very different in style but equivalent (at least) in core
        content to a traditional, on-campus, first-semester college-level introductory
        physics course that includes a laboratory. At the same time, those who
        cherry-pick selected course elements (e.g., learning the basics of video
        capture and analysis of motion in one’s own surroundings) will still advance
        their understanding of physics. &nbsp;&nbsp;
        <br>
    </p>
    <p>We aim to understand and to predict motion in the real world using a small
        set of powerful fundamental principles. The laboratories are the backbone
        of this course, providing opportunities (1) to observe and to analyze motion
        in our own surroundings, (2) to apply fundamental principles to build explanations
        of the motion, and (3) to evaluate, in a constructively critical way, our
        own measurements and models, as well as the measurements and models of
        our course peers. Other course elements (lecture videos with “clicker”
        questions, homework) support and extend the physics explored in the laboratories.</p>Participants
    who satisfactorily complete the course will be eligible for six (6) Continuing
    Education Units from the American Association of Physics Teachers.&nbsp;</div>

Title:  Understanding and Improving the US Healthcare System
Short desc:  In this course, you will learn about the structure, accomplishments, and shortcomings of the US healthcare system, and how those have prompted attempts at reform.  You will also take part in a unique, national group exercise, designed to help you understand how you can improve the US healthcare system.
Long desc:  <p>Health is important to everyone.&nbsp; For most people, that means that
understanding the healthcare system is important.&nbsp; As a patient or a caregiver for a loved one,
your understanding of the system can mean everything from getting the right
help, to economic stress in paying medical bills, to medical misadventures and
even death.&nbsp; And if you’re a healthcare
professional (or are in training or want to be a healthcare professional someday),
understanding the system is a critical – but often under-developed – part of
optimizing the help you can provide your community.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Despite this importance, an understanding of the US
healthcare system is alarmingly rare.&nbsp;
This course is designed to change that – by helping students understand
the core structure and accomplishments of the system, the recurring
shortcomings, and attempted remedies through policy reform.&nbsp; Rather than emphasizing complexity (a focus
of many other courses about healthcare policy), the lessons in this course will
highlight central themes that learners can take away from the course and apply
to their own experiences – and other coursework – with confidence.&nbsp; Moreover, students who seek more advanced
content will have ample opportunity to tailor their learning accordingly.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>In addition, through a unique, national group exercise
that will serve as a keystone of this course, all learners will have the
opportunity to learn how they can improve the US healthcare system.&nbsp; Whether as individuals, in groups, or as future
architects of system reform, students in this course will enjoy a premier
opportunity to understand the US healthcare system – and their options for addressing
problems in the system – as they never have before. &nbsp;This course is produced by Michael Rubyan, MPH, one of Dr. Davis's former students at the University of Michigan.</p>

Title:  Common Core in Action: Math Formative Assessment
Short desc:  This course offers participants an opportunity to engage in a community of learners using an inquiry cycle focusing on math formative assessments as a strategy for implementing CCSS in math. It focuses on the implementation of a Classroom Challenge: a 1 – 2 day lesson developed by the Mathematics Assessment Project (MAP) based on formative assessment and the CCSSM.
Long desc:  The Common Core State Standards in Mathematics (CCSSM) offer the opportunity for educators to transform teaching and learning by positioning students in more active roles as learners. In addition to explicit content standards (which describe what students will know), the CCSSM present a broad range of practice standards that describe ways that successful students in math demonstrate proficiency. What do students and teachers need to know to take on these standards? What does it mean, for example, for students to persevere through new and challenging problems, and/or critique the reasoning of other students, and how can their teachers best support them?<br><br>In the words of one math teacher, “it’s not the students’ job to figure out what is in our heads; it’s the teacher’s job to figure out what is in theirs.” Such an approach requires far more focus on formative assessment and deliberate strategies for teachers to pre-assess students’ assets, needs, and misconceptions – then move them forward while continually re-assessing. <br>

Title:  Caries Management by Risk Assessment (CAMBRA)
Short desc:  This course will provide the scientific basis for caries (dental decay) risk assessment and practice interventions.  You will immediately be able to apply “caries management by risk assessment” into your clinical setting or into your personal health care.
Long desc:  Dental Caries (tooth decay) is a bacterially based disease that progresses
when acid produced by bacterial action on dietary fermentable carbohydrates
travels into the tooth and dissolves the carbonated hydroxyapatite mineral.
 This process is<span> called demineralization.<br>
<br>
Pathological factors, including acidogenic bacteria, salivary dysfunction, and
dietary carbohydrates are related to caries progression.  Protective factors, which include
antibacterials, salivary calcium, phosphate and proteins, salivary flow, and
fluoride in saliva can balance, prevent or reverse dental caries through a
process of remineralization. 
Remineralization is a natural and reliable repair mechanism for
non-cavitated carious lesions.<br>
<br>
This course will provide the scientific basis behind the “caries balance”
concept, which is the key to caries management by risk assessment in clinical
practice.  If pathological factors
prevail caries progresses.  If protective
factors prevail the caries process is halted or reversed.<br>
<br>
The course will present tools to implement  CAMBRA, “caries management by risk assessment,”
in your clinical setting.  It can be in
implemented medical and dental settings, and can benefit children and adults of
all ages. Implementation in dental practice provides patients with genuine hope
and success for the management of their oral health.  It is a practice builder for dentistry.</span>

Title:  The Modern and the Postmodern
Short desc:  This course examines how the idea of "the modern" develops at the end of the 18th century in European philosophy and literature, and how being modern (or progressive, or hip) became one of the crucial criteria for understanding and evaluating cultural change. Are we still in modernity, or have we moved beyond the modern to the postmodern?
Long desc:  <b></b>In this
course we shall examine how the idea of "the modern" develops at the
end of the 18th century in European intellectual history, and how being modern (or progressive, or hip) became
one of the crucial criteria for understanding and evaluating cultural change
during the last two hundred years in the West. We shall be concerned with the relations
between culture and historical change, and our materials shall be drawn from a
variety of areas: philosophy, the novel, and critical theory. Finally, we shall try to
determine what it means to be modern today, and whether it makes sense to go
beyond the modern to the postmodern.



<p><i>The Modern and the Postmodern</i> traces the intertwining of the
idea of modernity with the idea of art or culture from the late 18th
century until the present. Beginning with the Enlightenment, Western cultures
have invested heavily in the notion that the world can be made more of a home
for human beings through the development of culture (and technology).
Throughout this period there has also developed a strong, sophisticated
counter-movement that sees the Enlightenment effort as a disaster – destructive
of both art and of the world.</p>



<p>The
Western idea of modernity is linked to but not the same as the idea of
modernism. We will examine both in this class and then consider postmodernism
in relation both to the philosophical idea of modernity and to the aesthetic
considerations of modernism.</p>



This course covers a lot of ground,
historically, conceptually and aesthetically. There is much to read, and very
different kinds of reading: from philosophy to novels, from theory to poetry.
Not all students will like all the reading, but if you digest it all, you
should have a clearer sense of the cultural history of our present. 



<br><br>Students
should develop a historical, literary and philosophical understanding of some
of the key themes of modernity and modernism in the West. They should learn to
read classic and contemporary texts for their arguments, beauty and pertinence.
They should see why these texts are “good to think with,” and, it is hoped,
they will develop an appetite for further study in the areas covered by the
course.

Title:  Introduction to Human Behavioral Genetics
Short desc:  Behavioral genetic methodologies from twin and adoption studies through DNA analysis will be described and applied to address longstanding questions about the origins of individual differences in behavioral traits.
Long desc:  <p>One of psychology’s defining issues concerns the origins of individual differences in behavior: Why are some people outgoing and cheerful while others are withdrawn and forlorn? Why do some struggle academically while others excel at school despite minimal
    study? Why do some suffer the ravages of a psychotic illness like schizophrenia while others enjoy a life free of mental illness? At the core to answering these questions is the ages-old "nature-nurture" debate: Are the behavioral differences among
    us due predominantly to inborn natural differences or the cumulative impact of our experiences? The nature-nurture debate generated much controversy and acrimony within psychology, although today most are willing to retire the debate and declare both
    sides victorious.</p>

<p>This course provides an introduction to behavioral genetics, the field within psychology that demonstrated that Nature and Nurture both play a fundamental role in the development of psychological traits. We will explore how early behavioral genetic research
    radically changed how psychologists conceptualized human behavior and how the mapping of the human genome is fundamentally altering current research approaches to a wide range of behavioral characteristics. The course will cover the traditional behavioral
    genetic methodologies of twin and adoption studies as well as modern approaches based on molecular genetic techniques.</p>

<p>Upon completion of the course, students should have a basic understanding of</p>

<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>how behavioral genetic research has changed psychology’s view of human behavior;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>the strengths and limitations of traditional behavioral genetic methodologies such as twin and adoption studies;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>the behavioral genetic approach to psychiatric phenotypes (to be illustrated by schizophrenia) and psychological phenotypes (to be illustrated by intelligence); and
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>the structure and function of the human genome and the prospects for identifying the specific genetic variants underlying individual differences in behavior.

Title:  The Fall and Rise of Jerusalem
Short desc:  Learn about Judah under Babylonian rule
Long desc:  The period of the demise of the Kingdom of Judah at the end of the sixth
century B.C.E., the fall of Jerusalem to the Babylonians, the exile of
the elite to Babylon, and the reshaping of the territory of the new province
of Judah, culminating at the end of the century with the first return of
exiles – all have been subjects of intense scrutiny in modern scholarship.
This course takes into account the biblical textual evidence, the results
of archaeological research, and the reports of the Babylonian and Egyptian
sources and provides a comprehensive survey and analysis of the evidence
for the history of this 100-year-long era. The course includes a detailed
discussion by Prof. Oded Lipschits of Tel Aviv University, with guest lectures
by leading scholars dealing with the archaeological and biblical aspects
of this debated topic.

Title:  What a Plant Knows (and other things you didn’t know about plants)
Short desc:  Can we say that plants have senses? You will learn how plants sense their environment and how scientists study plant senses. You will be exposed to both classic and modern experiments in plant biology, and may even start to question what defines us as humans.
Long desc:  For centuries we have collectively marveled at plant diversity and form—from
Charles Darwin’s early fascination with stems and flowers to Seymour Krelborn’s
distorted doting in Little Shop of Horrors. This course intends to present
an intriguing and scientifically valid look at how plants themselves experience
the world—from the colors they see to the sensations they feel. Highlighting
the latest research in genetics and more, we will delve into the inner
lives of plants and draw parallels with the human senses to reveal that
we have much more in common with sunflowers and oak trees than we may realize.
We’ll learn how plants know up from down, how they know when a neighbor
has been infested by a group of hungry beetles, and whether they appreciate
the music you’ve been playing for them or if they’re just deaf to the sounds
around them. We’ll explore definitions of memory and consciousness as they
relate to plants in asking whether we can say that plants might even be
aware of their surroundings. This highly interdisciplinary course meshes
historical studies with cutting edge modern research and will be relevant
to all humans who seek their place in nature. This class has three main
goals: 1. To introduce you to basic plant biology by exploring plant senses
(sight, smell, hearing, touch, taste, balance). 2. To introduce you to
biological research and the scientific method. 3. To get the student to
question life in general and what defines us as humans.

Title:  Applying to U.S. Universities
Short desc:  This course will help you understand how the U.S. university application and admission process works for international students and non-native English speakers applying to undergraduate (i.e., bachelor's degree) programs.
Long desc:  <p>“It depends.”  That is what you’ll hear when asking about the U.S.
university admission process.  With
over 4,000 universities in the United States and no standard application system,
the U.S. admission process can be confusing for everyone, but especially for
students applying from other countries.</p>

<p>This course will help international
students (non-U.S. citizens) and non-native English speakers navigate the U.S.
university admission process by offering practical information about the
documents and pieces that make up a U.S. university application.  More importantly, admission officers will
discuss how they use those pieces to decide who is accepted and who is denied,
so that you can understand the process beyond the pieces.</p>

<p>By the end of this course, you will
understand application basics that include researching schools, creating a
school list, and establishing an application plan.  This course will not answer all of your application
questions, but it will teach you to ask the right questions of yourself and the
universities.  Ultimately, you will
have all the information you need to start your process the right way, putting
you on the path to acceptance.</p><p>

















</p><p><i>* Please note, while the English Language Programs are part of
the University of Pennsylvania, this is not a course about applying to
Penn.  Furthermore, this course is
intended for international students educated in the national curriculum of
their country.  While other
students are welcome to enroll, the course is not intended for American
students or students studying in an American, International Baccalaureate, or
Advanced Placement curriculum.  The
course is also intended for students who do not have access to university counseling
– if you attend a school that offers university counseling, your counselor is
the best source of information on applying to university.  Finally, this course is for
undergraduate (Bachelors degree) freshmen (students who have not attended any
university) applicants. 
Undergraduate transfer applicants, students who have attended a
university, will find some of the information helpful, but graduate (Masters
and Doctoral) applicants will not.</i></p>

Title:  Understanding the Brain: The Neurobiology of Everyday Life
Short desc:  Learn how the nervous system produces behavior, how we use our brain every day, and how neuroscience can explain the common problems afflicting people today. We will study functional human neuroanatomy and neuronal communication, and then use this information to understand how we perceive the outside world, move our bodies voluntarily, stay alive, and play well with others.
Long desc:  <p>The
Neurobiology of Everyday Life is a 10-week course intended for anyone interested in how the nervous
system works. The course will cover three main topics: neuroanatomy, neural
communication, and neural systems. We will start by exploring the overall
organization of the human brain and the cellular building blocks of the brain –
neurons. We will examine how the incredibly complex brain develops from a ball
of embryonic cells and then look at the anatomy of nerves, the spinal cord, brainstem and
forebrain. An understanding of how blood reaches
the brain, the blood brain barrier, and the ventricular system will be used to
understand different types of strokes. At the end of the units on neuroanatomy, students will have a strong understanding of nerve injury,
spinal cord injury, traumatic brain injury, stroke, and brain tumors. </p><p>In
the neural communication module, we will look at how electrical potentials
carry information within neurons and how neurotransmitters are used to
communicate information between neurons. This module will illuminate what goes
wrong in epilepsy, demyelinating diseases such as multiple sclerosis, and myasthenia
gravis as well as how nerve gas, Botox, cocaine and beta-blockers act on
neurons.</p><p>






















</p><p>In
the final module, all of the fundamental anatomy and physiology from the first
two modules will be used to examine how 1) we perceive the outside world; 2) we
act in the world either volitionally or emotionally; 3) our nervous system allows
us to live; and 4) cognition works to make us the human individuals that we are.
We will look at the neurobiology of everyday situations such as multitasking
(walking and chewing gum) and at the ways in which the nervous system commonly
fails us (e.g. motion sickness). Students will emerge from this module with an
understanding of common medical problems such as Parkinson's disease, myopia,
hearing loss, and fever. Throughout the course, the neurobiology of items
relevant to the week’s topic (current events, YouTube videos, diseases) will be
discussed in weekly forums.</p><p><b>If you'd like to get started thinking about the brain now, follow us on <a href="http://www.twitter.com/neuromooc" target="_blank">Twitter @neuromooc!</a></b></p>

Title:  Modern European Mysticism and Psychological Thought
Short desc:  The course will examine the psychological thought of the modern mystical traditions in Europe. We shall focus on two topics with wider cultural implications – the soul and the heart. 

Long desc:  <p>In the revival of mysticism today, mysticism has become more psychological while psychology is increasingly interested in mysticism. This course will provide an entry into the complex world of modern mysticism, through studying its psychological thought. We shall begin with exploring the interpretations of mystical experience offered by psychoanalysts in the twentieth century, starting with Sigmund Freud and Carl Jung and ending with contemporary thinkers such as James Hillman. However, we will see that the European mystical traditions, including Kabbalah in the Jewish world and those of the Catholic, Orthodox and Protestant worlds, developed their own elaborate systems of psychological thought. Thus, we will mostly examine mystical psychology on its own terms. We shall especially look at two terms that are very much in use also in general culture: the heart (as an emotional rather than a physical center!...) and the soul, looking at the unique mystical concepts of their nature and destiny and asking if there were influences and meetings between the different religions.</p>

Title:  Microeconomics Principles
Short desc:  Introduction to the functions of individual decision-makers, both consumers and producers, within the larger economic system. Primary emphasis on the nature and functions of product markets, the theory of the firm under varying conditions of competition and monopoly, and the role of government in promoting efficiency in the economy.
Long desc:  <h2>Why 3 Versions?</h2>

<p><b>Note</b>: In January 2014 we will offer 3 versions of this course so
    that you can choose a version that best meets your needs. Two of the versions
    are identical except for the duration of the course. The third version
    is both shorter and covers slightly less material, focusing on just the most critical
    aspects of microeconomics principles. See further below for more details
    about the differences.</p>

<h2>About the Course</h2>

<p>Most people make the incorrect assumption that economics is ONLY the study
    of money.  My primary goal in this course is to shatter this belief.
     In fact, in the last 50 years economists have tackled some of the
    most interesting and important questions for humanity.  For instance,
    the following are just a few examples:</p>
<div>
    <ul>
        <li>About Love and Marriage
            <ul>
                <li>Why is the divorce rate so high and what should we do in order to reduce
                    it?</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>About the Environment

<p>Additional questions we will consider:</p>
<ul>
<li>What economists do and the strange way they think? (Basic Concepts, Modeling and Trade)</li>
<li>What determines prices and quantity
    in a market economy? (Supply and Demand)</li>
<li>What is the relationship between

<li>How much pollution is too much pollution?
    (Public Goods, Common Resources and Externalities)</li>
<p>We will be addressing many of these (and many more) questions
during this course. Again, my main goal will to show you the way economists
think and how to use this analytical system to answer questions related
not only to these and other important human issues but pretty much to anything
you end up doing with your life after this class. After all, as you will
quickly find out, I believe everything is economics!</p></ul>

Title:  Bioinformatics: Introduction and Methods 生物信息学: 导论与方法
Short desc:  This course teaches the concepts and computational methods in the exciting interdisciplinary field of bioinformatics and their applications in life sciences. The lectures are taught in both Mandarin Chinese and English with slides in English.
生物信息学是一门新兴的生命科学与计算科学的前沿交叉学科。本课程讲授生物信息学主要概念和方法，以及如何应用生物信息学手段解决生命科学问题。本课程同时提供中文普通话授课和英文授课两个版本，以及英文幻灯片。
Long desc:  <i></i>

<p>Welcome to "Bioinformatics: Introduction and Methods" at Peking University!</p>Bioinformatics is an advanced 
interdisciplinary field of life sciences and computer sciences, both of which had seen extraordinary development in the past three decades. The 
driving force of bioinformatics is the exponentially
    growing amount of big data generated by high-throughput biological 
technologies such as next-generation sequencing. For instance, the 
genomes of human and many animals and plants have now been sequenced. The 
total amount of DNA sequenced exceeds 2,000 trillion bases and doubles 
every five months.  These "Big Data" brought unprecedented opportunities for new discoveries,
    new patterns, and new hypotheses.  At the same time, the data is heterogeneous with low signal-to-noise ratio. Handling such big data requires advanced, efficient
    and accurate computational methods and computer tools.  <br><br>Bioinformatics is a powerful new technology for the efficient 
management, search, and analysis of petabytes of biological data. It is 
also a new top-down, genome-scale, system-oriented scientific 
methodology that complements traditional experimental approaches in life
 sciences research.  In this MOOC we will teach the important concepts and methods in 
bioinformatics. We will cover the underlying algorithms starting from 
simple sequence alignment and sequence search, and move on to genome 
alignment, next-generation sequencing data analysis,
    and molecular pathway identification. We will use software and 
databases that we had developed in our own labs to illustrate how to 
develop new bioinformatics technologies. We will also use real cases to 
demonstrate how to apply bioinformatics approaches
    in life sciences research. In addition, we will try to provide a 
historical perspective of why and how some of the ideas were developed, bringing to our class a few renowned scientists to tell us about their seminal works and perspectives.<br><br>This MOOC is based on the popular "Methods in Bioinformatics" course 
that we created in 2006 and taught in every fall semester since at 
Peking University. The first run of this MOOC at Coursera in fall, 2013 had over 17,000 registered students from over 40 countries.  We hope that this MOOC can help you acquire knowledge and skills in bioinformatics that can be valuable in your future study and research.<p>

Title:  Introduction to Music Production
Short desc:  Learn about the music production process—including recording, editing, and mixing—and the tools available to you to create contemporary music on your computer. 
Long desc:  With the recent introduction of high-quality-low-cost software and hardware, the tools of music production are now available to the masses. Albums are made in bedrooms as well as studios. On the surface this is liberating. Anyone can make an album for the low cost of a couple pieces of gear and a software package. But, if you dig deeper, you will find that it is not so easy. Producing music requires knowledge, <b></b>dedication, and creativity.<br>    <br>Knowledge is where this course comes in. No matter what kind of music you are making, there is a large set of tools that you will need to use.  Each lesson of this course will demonstrate a different set of music production tools, loosely following along the music production process of recording, editing, and mixing. <br><br>We will start with some background on the nature of sound and how we perceive it. We will then examine the components necessary to record audio into a computer, so that you understand the devices that sound must travel through in a music production process. <br>    <br>Once recorded, sound must be organized along a timeline, a process known as editing. It allows us to give the impression of perfect performances and create many of the sounds we hear in contemporary music. The contemporary editing tool is the Digital Audio Workstation (DAW),  a piece of software that stores and organizes all the assets of a musical project. We will focus on the editing tools that are essential in contemporary music production and that all DAWs provide. <br><br>After editing, sounds must be combined or mixed together, so we look to the mixing board—a very creative place if you know how to use it. We will explore the basic functionality of both hardware and software mixing boards, including volume, pan, mute, solo, busses, inserts, sends, and submixes. The mixing process, however, includes more tools than the mixing board provides on its own. Sound must also be processed, modified from its recorded state to fit the context of the music. We will look at compression, equalization, and delay, and examine the many audio effects that are offshoots of these devices and how they are used in a musical context.<br>    <br>We will then explore the synthesizer, a major tool within the production of contemporary music. Yes, great music can and will be created without the synthesizer, but learning how a synthesizer works will give you a language to describe sound. Music is a collaborative art form, so there is nothing more powerful than effective communication. <br>    <br>In the end, the music production process relies on your creativity. Creativity is a product of the mind and will stay there, unexpressed, until the right tools are used in the right way to share it with the world. If you have an idea in your head, it will take numerous steps, each with an important tool, to reach your audience. You bring the dedication and creativity, and this course will bring you the knowledge to make that happen.<br>

Title:  Jazz Improvisation
Short desc:  Learn the basic concepts of improvisation from Gary Burton, one of the most renowned improvisers in the jazz world, including the mental, melodic, and harmonic processes that contribute to the instinctive skills that an improviser puts to use when taking a solo.
Long desc:  While many people are fans of
jazz and understand that musicians are often “making up” the
notes they are playing during a performance, most people—often
including musicians, themselves, who are beginning to learn improvising—aren’t
clear about what exact processes take place to enable this to happen. The
purpose of this course is to introduce the basic concepts of modern improvisation and
how to go about mastering the different musical and mental skills involved. <br><br>Course author Gary Burton codifies a sought-after approach to improvisation that has been at the 
core of Berklee College of Music's curriculum for decades. Students who complete
this course will know what to practice and how to practice the
various aspects of improvising, in addition to understanding how the improviser spontaneously
communicates to the listeners through their musical creations.

Short desc:  Learn an efficient, effective process for writing songs that express your ideas and emotions, including a range of tools that revolve around the concept of prosody—the matching of lyrics and music to support your underlying message. 
Long desc:  There’s a songwriter lurking somewhere inside you, peeking
around corners, wondering if it’s safe to come out. Now it is. This course is an
invitation to let your inner songwriter step into the sunlight. All it takes is
a simple “yes” and you’ll be climbing that windy hill, marveling at the view.<br><br>If you haven’t written any or many songs, this course will show you
an efficient, effective process for tailoring songs to express your ideas and
emotions. If you have, you’ll look at your process differently, taking control
of aspects of the process you may have not noticed.<br><br>The course will start by examining the tools available to you, all
revolving around the essential concept of <i>prosody</i>. You’ll learn to use your
tools to enhance your message—to work compositionally at the same time you’re
developing your ideas.<br><br>You’ll be working both lyrically and musically, though
musically it’s not necessary that you either read music or play an instrument.
If you play, great, and you’ll be encouraged to play and record your musical
responses to the assignments. If you don’t play, the course offers you a number
of musical loops to work with. All you’ll have to do is sing your melodies over
the loops.<br><br>Assignments will ask you to post something for peer review—sometimes lyric lines or sections, sometimes
melodies, sometimes both. None of it has to be polished. The course is about writing,
not performing.<br><br>Most important, you’ll have a lot of fun.

Title:  Exploring Beethoven’s Piano Sonatas
Short desc:  A series of lectures on one of the greatest bodies of music ever composed, from the point of view of a performer. Each lecture will explore a different facet of the music; all will attempt to locate the source of the tremendous psychological power of Beethoven’s music.
Long desc:  <p>
















</p><p></p><p>Our relationship to Beethoven is a deep and paradoxical one. For
many musicians, he represents a kind of holy grail: His music has an intensity,
rigor, and profundity which keep us in its thrall, and it is perhaps unequalled
in the interpretive, technical, and even spiritual challenges it poses to
performers. At the same time, Beethoven’s music is casually familiar to
millions of people who do not attend concerts or consider themselves musically
inclined. Two hundred years after his death, he is everywhere in the culture,
yet still represents its summit.</p>

<p>This course takes an inside-out look at the 32 piano sonatas
from the point of view of a performer. Each lecture will focus on one sonata
and an aspect of Beethoven’s music exemplified by it. (These might include: the
relationship between Beethoven the pianist and Beethoven the composer; the
critical role improvisation plays in his highly structured music; his mixing of
extremely refined music with rougher elements; and the often surprising ways in
which the events of his life influenced his compositional process and the
character of the music he was writing.) The course will feature some analysis
and historical background, but its perspective is that of a player, not a
musicologist. Its main aim is to explore and demystify the work of the
performer, even while embracing the eternal mystery of Beethoven’s music
itself.</p>

Course ID:  972054
Title:  Analyse Numérique pour Ingénieurs
Short desc:  Ce cours contient les 7 premiers chapitres d'un cours donné aux étudiants bachelor de l'EPFL. Il est basé sur le livre "Introduction à l'analyse numérique", J. Rappaz M. Picasso, Ed. PPUR. Des outils de base sont décrits dans les 5 premiers chapitres. Les deux derniers chapitres abordent la question de la résolution numérique d'équations différentielles. 

Long desc:  L'analyse numérique fait partie de ce que l'on appelle aujourd'hui "Scientific Computing" ou encore "Computational Sciences". Il s'agit de faire des simulations numériques de phénomènes complexes, par exemple l'écoulement autour d'un avion, le retrait passé ou futur d'un glacier, ou encore des effets spéciaux pour l'industrie du cinéma. <br><br>Le cheminement permettant d'obtenir une simulation numérique est le suivant.<br><span><br>

<ul><li>Dérivation d'un modèle mathématique. Par exemple, dans le cas de la chute d'un corps, les équations de Newton "masse x accéleration = forces" permettent d'obtenir une équation différentielle, à laquelle il faut ajouter une condition initiale sur la position et sur la vitesse du corps.</li>
<br>
<li>Analyse mathématique : le modèle mathématique obtenu est-il bien posé ? Par exemple, l'existence d'une solution unique de l'équation différentielle demande que certaines conditions sur les forces soient satisfaites.<br></li>
<br>
<li>Analyse numérique : en général, la solution du modèle mathématique ne peut pas être obtenue de manière explicite. Il convient d'utiliser un algorithme permettant d'approcher la solution grâce à un ordinateur. Dans la mesure du possible on souhaite quantifier l'erreur entre la solution du modèle mathématique (que l'on ne connait pas) et son approximation numérique (que l'on va calculer sur un ordinateur). Pour le choix de l'algorithme, on tiendra compte du nombre d'opérations nécessaire au calcul de la solution approchée.</li>
<br>
<li>Implémentation sur ordinateur (programmation).</li>
<br>
<li>Tests, validation et comparaison avec l'expérience ou d'autres résultats numériques.<br></li></ul></span>

Title:  Introduction to Mathematical Philosophy
Short desc:  Learn how to apply mathematical methods to philosophical problems and questions.
Long desc:  <p>Since antiquity, philosophers have questioned the foundations--the foundations of the physical world, of our everyday experience, of our scientific knowledge, and of culture and society. In recent
years, more and more young philosophers have become convinced
that, in order to understand these foundations, and thus to make progress in
philosophy, the use of mathematical methods is of crucial importance.
This is what our course will be concerned with:
mathematical philosophy, that is, philosophy done with the help of mathematical
methods.</p><p></p><p>As we will try to show, one can analyze philosophical concepts much more clearly in mathematical terms, one can derive philosophical conclusions from philosophical assumptions by mathematical proof, and one can build mathematical models in which we can study philosophical problems.</p><p></p><p>So, as Leibniz would have said: even in philosophy, <i>calculemus</i>. Let's calculate.</p><p></p><p></p>

Title:  New Models of Business in Society
Short desc:  Examine the critical role that business plays in society, and learn about the exciting new models of business that are changing the way that companies create value.
Long desc:  <p>This course examines the emergence of a new story about
business. This new story locates
business within a societal framework. Almost every business creates or destroys value for customers,
suppliers, employees, communities and society, in addition to shareholders and
other financiers. A number of new models
of business can be built on this idea such as corporate
responsibility, philanthropy, shared value and sustainability. Profits and stakeholder value go together,
and this course explains how. The final
session explores the idea of how to become a stakeholder entrepreneur and
create a business that makes money and makes the world a better place.<br></p>

Title:  Learning to Teach Online
Short desc:  Based upon the successful educational resources of the same name, the Learning to Teach Online (LTTO) MOOC is designed to help existing educators establish or improve their own online or blended teaching practices. The target audience is primarily teachers in higher education, K-12, community college, and vocational or private education.
Long desc:  <p>Are you an
educator? Have you ever wanted to understand more about how to design your
course to make better use of educational technology – whether fully online or
in blended contexts? Would you like to learn from those who have extensive
practical experience with online technologies? This course is designed to help
you develop a working understanding of successful online teaching strategies
that you can apply in your own practice. </p>

<p>Integrating
online technologies into your teaching can be a challenging prospect, and it
can be difficult to know how to approach it effectively for the benefit of both
students and yourself. No one knows your own content and teaching strengths
better than you, and the “one size fits all” formula doesn’t always suit
everyone. No matter what type of technology you are interested in exploring or
your level of experience, this course will help you draw on your teaching
strengths and find the approach that is right for you, your students and your
educational context. <span>To allow both for breadth in
personalization and depth in key areas that interest you, this course will guide
you through your journey of understanding how online technologies can enhance
your course design.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><b>ABOUT THE COURSE</b>
    <br>
</p>
<p>Not too long ago, it was believed that anyone who graduated from a doctoral program was capable of teaching. In recent years, however, it has become apparent that teaching is not an intuitive behavior. In addition to content, teaching also involves a
    complex intellectual process, and to develop the “art” of teaching, professors require guidance and support. As the roles and responsibilities of university-level educators have evolved and expanded in recent years, the preparation of emerging university
    faculty leaders must focus on the development of the knowledge, skills, and strategies for teaching and learning in higher education. This short course is designed to introduce the strategies and exemplars of university teaching skills necessary to
    meet these new professional demands for teaching at a university level.  </p>

Title:  Algorithmic Thinking
Short desc:  Experienced Computer Scientists analyze and solve computational problems at a level of abstraction that is beyond that of any particular programming language.  This class is designed to train students in the mathematical concepts and process of "Algorithmic Thinking", allowing them to build simpler, more efficient solutions to computational problems.

Long desc:  <div>When presented with a problem from a scientific domain, a Computer Scientist goes through a set of steps in order to provide a solution for the problem. These steps include: (1) understanding the problem; (2) formulating the problem mathematically; (3) designing an algorithm; (4) implementing the algorithm; and (5) solving the original scientific problem. This course will train students in how to employ algorithmic thinking by following these five steps to solve real-world problems. </div><div><br></div><div>Understanding the problem entails holding conversations with domain experts to understand the parameters of the problem, what data they can provide to the computer program, what answers they expect, etc. Formulating the problem mathematically is basically the step of turning the problem from an English description to a mathematical description that is amenable to further computational analyses. </div><div><br></div><div>While the course emphasizes implementing the algorithms and solving the original problems that gave rise to the need for these algorithms in the first place, much of the course will be devoted to the third step, namely, algorithm design. Here, the course will introduce students to different algorithm design strategies, as well as mathematical tools for reasoning about the correctness and efficiency of algorithms.  </div>

    background learn the basics of building simple interactive applications.
    &nbsp;Our language of choice, Python, is an easy-to learn, high-level computer
    language that is used in many of the computational courses offered on Coursera.
    To make learning Python easy, we have developed a new browser-based programming
    environment that makes developing interactive applications in Python simple.
    &nbsp;These applications will involve windows whose contents are graphical
    and respond to buttons, the keyboard and the mouse.
    <br>
    <br>The primary method for learning the course material will be to work through
    multiple "mini-projects" in Python. &nbsp;To make this class enjoyable,
    these projects will include building fun games such as Pong, Blackjack,
    and Asteroids. &nbsp;When you’ve finished our course, we can’t promise
    that you will be a professional programmer, but we think that you will
    learn a lot about programming in Python and have fun while you’re doing
    it.</div>

Title:  Reproducible Research
Short desc:  Learn the concepts and tools behind reporting modern data analyses in a reproducible manner. This is the fifth course in the Johns Hopkins Data Science Specialization.
Long desc:  This course focuses on the concepts and tools behind reporting modern data analyses in a reproducible manner. Reproducible research is the idea that data analyses, and more generally, scientific claims, are published with their data and software code so that others may verify the findings and build upon them.  The need for reproducibility is increasing dramatically as data analyses become more complex, involving larger datasets and more sophisticated computations. Reproducibility allows for people to focus on the actual content of a data analysis, rather than on superficial details reported in a written summary. In addition, reproducibility makes an analysis more useful to others because the data and code that actually conducted the analysis are available. This course will focus on literate statistical analysis tools which allow one to publish data analyses in a single document that allows others to easily execute the same analysis to obtain the same results.

Title:  Statistical Inference
Short desc:  Learn how to draw conclusions about populations or scientific truths from data. This is the  sixth course in the Johns Hopkins Data Science Course Track.
Long desc:  Statistical inference is the process of drawing conclusions about populations or scientific truths from data. There are many modes of performing inference including statistical modeling, data oriented strategies and explicit use of designs and randomization in analyses. Furthermore, there are broad theories (frequentists, Bayesian, likelihood, design based, …) and numerous complexities (missing data, observed and unobserved confounding, biases) for performing inference. A practitioner can often be left in a debilitating maze of techniques, philosophies and nuance. This course presents the fundamentals of inference in a practical approach for getting things done. After taking this course, students will understand the broad directions of statistical inference and use this information for making informed choices in analyzing data.

Title:  Global Warming: The Science of Climate Change
Short desc:  This class describes the science of global warming and the forecast for humans’ impact on Earth’s climate. Intended for an audience without much scientific background but a healthy sense of curiosity, the class brings together insights and perspectives from physics, chemistry, biology, earth and atmospheric sciences, and even some economics—all based on a foundation of simple mathematics (algebra). 
Long desc:  <p>We start with basic principles governing
Earth’s temperature. The class begins
with the nature of heat and light, then builds the very simplest conceptual—and
algebraic—model for the climate of a planet, including the greenhouse effect.</p><p>Over the following weeks, we introduce
complexities of the real world to this model: how greenhouse gases are
selective about what light they absorb, how the temperature structure and weather
in the atmosphere set the stage for the greenhouse effect, and how
feedbacks amplify it. From this
point on the exercises will be based on
on-line interactive models for various aspects of Earth’s
climate and carbon cycle, exploring the topics
described in the video lectures.&nbsp;</p><p>We then turn to the carbon cycle of
the Earth,&nbsp;how it stabilizes Earth’s climate on some time scales but
destabilizes it on others. The fate of fossil fuel carbon will
be determined by its integration into Earth’s ongoing natural
carbon cycle.</p><p>






























</p><p>The class concludes with a look
at the human impact on Earth’s climate: why we believe it’s
changing, why we believe we’re changing it, the impacts that could have, and
the options we have to mitigate the situation.</p>

Title:  Programming Cloud Services for Android Handheld Systems
Short desc:  In this course----the third in a trans-institution sequence of MOOCs on Mobile Cloud Computing with Android--we will learn how to connect Android mobile devices to cloud computing and data storage resources, essentially turning a device into an extension of powerful cloud-based services on popular cloud computing platforms, such as Google App Engine and Amazon EC2. 
Long desc:  This MOOC describes <i>by example</i> how to&nbsp;connect Android mobile devices to clouds&nbsp;via the use of object-oriented design techniques,&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_(programming_language)">Java</a> programming language features,
<a href="http://www.eclipse.org/jetty/">Jetty</a> middleware, <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/index-jsp-135475.html" target="_blank">Java Servlets</a>, the <a href="http://projects.spring.io/spring-framework/" target="_blank">Java Spring Framework</a>,
and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing">cloud computing platforms</a>, such as <a href="https://developers.google.com/appengine/">Google App Engine</a>.
<br>
<br>An extended case study project will be used throughout the MOOC to showcase architectures for communicating with the cloud using HTTP, server-side processing of mobile data using servlets and the Java Spring Framework, and scalable storage of data using
no-SQL databases and other platforms.
<br>
<br>Because of the importance of building secure and scalable mobile/cloud platforms, this MOOC will not only show you how to program handheld systems that talk to the cloud, but how to do so securely, scalably, and efficiently. Security and scalability topics
will be woven into discussions of cloud service creation so that students learn, from the start, how to create robust cloud services for mobile devices.&nbsp;
<br>
<br>Although the cloud service topics in this course will be taught in the context of connecting mobile devices to the cloud, the concepts are broader and will give students the ability to create the cloud services to support large-scale web applications,
such as social networking applications; cloud services for embedded systems, such as the Internet of Things and Industrial Internet; and wearable computing devices, such as Google Glass.
<br>
<p>
    <br>
    <b>Note: This course is part of a trans-institution sequence of MOOCs entitled <A HREF="https://www.coursera.org/specialization/mobilecloudcomputing/2">Mobile Cloud Computing with Android</A></b>
</p>
This MOOC and two others, taught by <a href="http://www.cs.umd.edu/~aporter">Dr. Adam Porter</a> from the University of Maryland and <a href="http://www.dre.vanderbilt.edu/~schmidt">Dr. Douglas C. Schmidt</a> from Vanderbilt University, have been designed
to complement one another as part of the first trans-institution Specialization taught on the Coursera platform. Some of the programming assignments and the course project for these MOOCs will be coordinated. Dr. Porter's MOOC, <a href="https://www.coursera.org/course/android">Programming Mobile Applications for Android Handheld Systems</a>,
will be taught first; it focuses on the design and programming of user-facing application components. Dr. Schmidt's MOOC,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.coursera.org/course/posa">Programming Mobile Services for Android Handheld Systems</a>,&nbsp;will be taught
next; it focuses on middleware systems programming topics, such as synchronous and asynchronous concurrency models, background service processing, structured data management, local inter-process communication and networking. This MOOC introduces the concepts
and knowledge needed to connect the user-facing and service-based components, built in the first two courses, to the cloud.
<br>
<br>
<p>If you just want to take some of the MOOCs in this sequence or take them all in different order you’re certainly welcome to do so, and you’ll still learn a lot. If you take all the MOOCs in this sequence in the order presented, however, you’ll gain a
    deeper, end-to-end understanding of handheld systems, their applications and services, as well as their integration into the cloud.

Long desc:  This course is a scientific exploration of our solar system. You will learn both what we know about the solar system around us but also how we have been using the tools of science to learn the things that we know. You will get to use some of the tools yourself.<br><br>Unlike typical solar system classes, which plod from one planet to the next, we will focus our examination of the solar system on four main topics: (1) Where is there water on Mars? (2) What is inside of a giant planet? (3) How can we use the smallest bodies in the solar system to answer the biggest questions? (4) Where might we look for life?<br><br>To answer these questions we will learn about details of atmospheric chemistry and dynamics, planetary interiors and magnetism, the geological history of planets, spacecraft exploration, telescopic observations of planets around other stars, spectroscopic determinations of composition, biochemistry of water- and non-water based life, and many more. In short, we'll learn about the whole solar system and about planets in other systems besides ours.<br>

				<div>
					<p>“媒介批评”是现代大众传播学的重要分支,简单而言,就是批评媒介,是
对大众传播媒介本身进行批评,属于应用传播学的研究领域。随着技术的进步和
传媒产业的不断发展,“媒介化社会”的到来,媒介在现代社会中产生越来越重
要的影响。为了保证媒介自身的良性发展,需要对媒介本身进行制约,以明确媒介的边界。因此,如何对媒介及其传播的信息进行反思性评判,是媒介批评要解决的主要问题。
</p>
					<p>媒介批评就是指立足于批判的价值立场、传播观念和理论背景,对大众传播
活动的政治经济机制、媒介机构和从业者、媒介的基本形态、媒介产品、媒介文
本及内容,以及媒介受众等所进行的理论观察、分析、评价等批判性反思活动。
媒介批评研究基于人文学科和社会科学的基本研究方法,以大众传播活动及其媒介产品为主要研究对象。简言之,媒介批评就是立足于批判的价值立场对媒介活
动及其产品和传播观念进行研究。因此,明确的价值立场和反思性批判是媒介批评的本质。
</p>
					<p>“Media criticism” is an important branch of modern mass
communication. In a word, it, which belongs to the field of application
communication studies, is to criticize media. With the technology
advancing, the media industry developing and “social media” arriving,
the media is playing a more and more important role in the modern society.
To guarantee the positive development of the media itself, the media
itself need to be restricted so as to make clear its boundary. Therefore,
how to carry out the reflective judgment on the media and information is
the main problem of media criticism which still remains to be solved.
</p>
					<p>Media criticism refers to reflective judgment, which bases on the
criticism of the value standpoint, the dissemination of the concept and
the theory background. Media criticism is the observation, analysis,

Title:  Introduction to Systems Biology
Short desc:  An introduction to current concepts of how cellular molecules come together to form systems, how these systems exhibit emergent properties, and how these properties are used to make cellular decisions.
Long desc:  <p>This
course will introduce the student to contemporary Systems Biology focused on
mammalian cells, their constituents and their functions. Biology is moving from molecular to modular.
As our knowledge of our genome and gene expression deepens and we develop lists
of molecules (proteins, lipids, ions) involved in cellular processes, we need
to understand how these molecules interact with each other to form modules that
act as discrete functional systems. These systems underlie core subcellular processes such as signal
transduction, transcription, motility and electrical excitability. In turn
these processes come together to exhibit cellular behaviors such as secretion,
proliferation and action potentials. What are the properties of such subcellular
and cellular systems? What are the
mechanisms by which emergent behaviors of systems arise? What types of experiments inform systems-level
thinking? Why do we need computation and simulations to understand these
systems?</p>

<p>The course will develop multiple lines of
reasoning to answer the questions listed above. Two major reasoning threads
are: the design, execution and interpretation of multivariable experiments that

Title:  Dynamical Modeling Methods for Systems Biology
Short desc:  An introduction to dynamical modeling techniques used in contemporary Systems Biology research.
Long desc:  <p>We
take a case-based approach to teach contemporary mathematical modeling
techniques. The course is appropriate
for advanced undergraduates and beginning graduate students. Lectures provide biological background and
describe the development of both classical mathematical models and more recent
representations of biological processes. The course will be useful for students who plan to use experimental
techniques as their approach in the laboratory and employ computational modeling
as a tool to draw deeper understanding of experiments. The course should also
be valuable as an introductory overview for students planning to conduct
original research in modeling biological systems.</p>



This course focuses on
dynamical modeling techniques used in Systems Biology research.  These techniques are based on biological
mechanisms, and simulations with these models generate predictions that can
subsequently be tested experimentally. These testable predictions frequently
provide novel insight into biological processes. The approaches taught here can be grouped
into the following categories: 1)
ordinary differential equation-based models, 2) partial differential
equation-based models, and 3) stochastic models.  <br>

Title:  Preventing Chronic Pain: A Human Systems Approach
Short desc:  Chronic pain is at epidemic levels and has become the highest-cost condition in health care. This course uses both creative and experiential learning to better understand chronic pain conditions and how they can be prevented through self-management in our cognitive, behavioral, physical, emotional, spiritual, social, and environmental realms.
Long desc:  <span><p>Chronic musculoskeletal pain (including head, neck, and back pain) is a significant cause of suffering, disability, and health care in the world. Care for chronic pain often involves surgery, multiple medications (including opioids), endless physical and chiropractic therapy, injections, implanted devices, and other passive treatments-- making it the highest cost condition in health care. The burden upon individuals in terms of ongoing pain and suffering is incalculable.</p><p>Consider an alternative. By using a human systems approach, we can better understand how individual risk factors in the cognitive, behavioral, physical, emotional, spiritual, social, and environmental realms of our lives can interact to perpetuate chronic pain and, if improved, can prevent it.  </p><p>During this course, you will: Identify the problems of our health care system in dealing with chronic pain. Review the diagnosis, mechanisms, and etiology of musculoskeletal pain conditions. Explore specific risk factors that can contribute to chronic pain. Learn how a human systems approach can be applied through evidence-based self-management strategies to prevent chronic pain.

Title:  Citizenship and U.S. Immigration
Short desc:  What does it mean for an immigrant to become a U.S. citizen? Through a background of historical and policy perspectives, this course will examine U.S. law governing how citizenship is acquired, the constitutional and international law foundations underlying immigration regulation, the role of the federal government in regulating immigration, and immigration law reform.  
Long desc:  <p>This course analyzes the
historical origins of citizenship and immigration in the United States and provides
an overview of modern U.S. law.  Beyond
traditional notions of “law,” the course also includes significant elements of
immigration policy, social science, history, political theory, and ethics.  One goal of the course is to provide a basic
knowledge base for students to make and influence law and policy in immigration
and citizenship.</p>

<p>Among the questions the

Title:  Søren Kierkegaard - Subjectivity, Irony and the Crisis of Modernity
Short desc:  In this course we will explore how Kierkegaard deals with the problems associated with relativism, the lack of meaning and the undermining of religious faith that are typical of modern life. His penetrating analyses are still highly relevant today and have been seen as insightful for the leading figures of Existentialism, Post-Structuralism and Post-Modernism.

Long desc:  <p><i><b></b></i>It is often claimed that relativism, subjectivism and nihilism are typically
    modern philosophical problems that emerge with the breakdown of traditional
    values, customs and ways of life. The result is the absence of meaning,
    the lapse of religious faith, and feeling of alienation that is so widespread
    in modernity.
    <br>
</p>
<p>The Danish thinker Søren Kierkegaard (1813-55) gave one of the most penetrating
    analyses of this complex phenomenon of modernity. But somewhat surprisingly he seeks
    insight into it not in any modern thinker but rather in an ancient one,
    the Greek philosopher Socrates.</p>

Title:  Modern & Contemporary American Poetry
Short desc:  ModPo is a fast-paced introduction to modern and contemporary U.S. poetry, with an emphasis on experimental verse, from Dickinson and Whitman to the present. Participants (who need no prior experience with poetry) will learn how to read poems that are supposedly "difficult."
Long desc:  In this fast-paced course we will read and encounter and discuss a great range of modern and contemporary U.S. poets working in the "experimental mode," starting with the 19th-century proto-modernists Emily Dickinson and Walt Whitman and ending with 21st-century conceptual poetics. Aside from providing a perhaps handy or helpful survey and chronology of 20th- and 21st-century poetry, this course offers a way of understanding general cultural transitions from modernism to postmodernism. Some people may wish to enroll as much to gain an understanding of the modernism/postmodernism problem through a study of poetry as to gain access to the work of these many poets. Participants do not need to have any prior knowledge of poetry or poetics. The instructor, Al Filreis, rarely lectures, and frequently calls for "the end of the lecture as we know it"; instead, the video-recorded lessons will consist of collaborative close readings led by Filreis, seminar-style -- offering models or samples of readers' interpretations of these knotty but powerful poems, aided by the poetry-minded denizens of the Kelly Writers House on the campus of the University of Pennsylvania.

Title:  Reproducible Research
Short desc:  Learn the concepts and tools behind reporting modern data analyses in a reproducible manner. This is the fifth course in the Johns Hopkins Data Science Specialization.
Long desc:  This course focuses on the concepts and tools behind reporting modern data analyses in a reproducible manner. Reproducible research is the idea that data analyses, and more generally, scientific claims, are published with their data and software code so that others may verify the findings and build upon them.  The need for reproducibility is increasing dramatically as data analyses become more complex, involving larger datasets and more sophisticated computations. Reproducibility allows for people to focus on the actual content of a data analysis, rather than on superficial details reported in a written summary. In addition, reproducibility makes an analysis more useful to others because the data and code that actually conducted the analysis are available. This course will focus on literate statistical analysis tools which allow one to publish data analyses in a single document that allows others to easily execute the same analysis to obtain the same results.

Title:  Statistical Inference
Short desc:  Learn how to draw conclusions about populations or scientific truths from data. This is the  sixth course in the Johns Hopkins Data Science Course Track.
Long desc:  Statistical inference is the process of drawing conclusions about populations or scientific truths from data. There are many modes of performing inference including statistical modeling, data oriented strategies and explicit use of designs and randomization in analyses. Furthermore, there are broad theories (frequentists, Bayesian, likelihood, design based, …) and numerous complexities (missing data, observed and unobserved confounding, biases) for performing inference. A practitioner can often be left in a debilitating maze of techniques, philosophies and nuance. This course presents the fundamentals of inference in a practical approach for getting things done. After taking this course, students will understand the broad directions of statistical inference and use this information for making informed choices in analyzing data.

Title:  Statistical Inference
Short desc:  Learn how to draw conclusions about populations or scientific truths from data. This is the  sixth course in the Johns Hopkins Data Science Course Track.
Long desc:  Statistical inference is the process of drawing conclusions about populations or scientific truths from data. There are many modes of performing inference including statistical modeling, data oriented strategies and explicit use of designs and randomization in analyses. Furthermore, there are broad theories (frequentists, Bayesian, likelihood, design based, …) and numerous complexities (missing data, observed and unobserved confounding, biases) for performing inference. A practitioner can often be left in a debilitating maze of techniques, philosophies and nuance. This course presents the fundamentals of inference in a practical approach for getting things done.

Title:  A Beginner's Guide to Irrational Behavior
Short desc:  Behavioral economics couples scientific research on the psychology of decision making with economic theory to better understand what motivates financial decisions. In A Beginner’s Guide to Irrational Behavior, you will learn about some of the many ways in which we behave in less than rational ways, and how we might overcome our shortcomings. You’ll also learn about cases where our irrationalities work in our favor, and how we can harness these human tendencies to make better decisions.
Long desc:  This course will draw heavily on my own research, and pulls&nbsp;largely&nbsp;from my three books:&nbsp;<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Predictably-Irrational-Revised-Expanded-Edition/dp/0061353248/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1361031703&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=dan+ariely" target="_blank">Predictably Irrational</a>&nbsp;(2008),&nbsp;<a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Upside-Irrationality-Unexpected-Benefits/dp/0061995045/ref=tmm_pap_title_0?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1361031759&amp;sr=8-6" target="_blank">The Upside of Irrationality</a>&nbsp;(2010), and&nbsp;<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Honest-Truth-About-Dishonesty-Everyone---Especially/dp/0062183591/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1361031810&amp;sr=8-3&amp;keywords=dan+ariely" target="_blank">The Honest Truth About Dishonesty</a>&nbsp;(2012).&nbsp;We will examine topics such as our “irrational” patterns of thinking about money and investments, how expectations shape perception, economic and psychological analyses of dishonesty by honest people, how social and financial incentives work together (or against each other) in labor, how self-control comes into play with decision making, and how emotion (rather than cognition) can have a large impact on economic decisions.&nbsp;This highly interdisciplinary course will be relevant to all human beings. <br><br><div><strong>The goals of this class:</strong></div><ol><li>Introduce you to the range of cases where people (consumers, investors, managers, friends, significant others, and even you) might make decisions that are inconsistent with standard economic theory and the assumptions of rational decision making. This is the lens of behavioral economics.</li><li>Help you think creatively about the applications of behavioral economics to the development of new products, technologies and public policy, and to understand how business and social policy strategies could be modified with a deeper understanding of the effects these principles have on all of us.</li></ol>

Title:  Developing Your Musicianship
Short desc:  Learn the basic concepts and approaches needed to understand, create, and perform contemporary music. 
Long desc:  <p>If you have a passion for music and are curious about how it works,
or if you are a musician who learned to play by ear without formal study, this
course will provide you with an engaging introduction to key concepts and
approaches needed to understand, create, and perform contemporary music. Taught
by Berklee College of Music professor George W. Russell, Jr., the course
includes six lessons that delve into harmony and ear training—two areas of
intensive focus for every entering Berklee student. <br></p><p>The course will teach you
the major scale and minor pentatonic scale, and how they are constructed. You will
learn what intervals are, how to sing them, and how to find them in music. The
course explores tonal centers and how to find the key a song is in, in addition
to common time signatures such as 4/4 and 3/4. You will learn how to build
chords—major and minor triads, and major and dominant seventh chords—and how to
build a common chord progression—the I IV V. You will also learn how to
recognize the blues and AABA song forms, and write a basic chord sheet to
express your song ideas. <br></p><p>In addition to the video lectures, each lesson
features Berklee student performances and interviews. The students share their
musical journey and offer advice for those wanting to study music. The course
culminates with an assignment that asks you to compose and perform a riff blues
tune using the minor pentatonic scale. Above all, the course is designed to
share the joy of creating music and sharing it with others.</p>

Title:  Introduction to Music Production
Short desc:  Learn about the music production process—including recording, editing, and mixing—and the tools available to you to create contemporary music on your computer. 
Long desc:  With the recent introduction of high-quality-low-cost software and hardware, the tools of music production are now available to the masses. Albums are made in bedrooms as well as studios. On the surface this is liberating. Anyone can make an album for the low cost of a couple pieces of gear and a software package. But, if you dig deeper, you will find that it is not so easy. Producing music requires knowledge, <b></b>dedication, and creativity.<br>    <br>Knowledge is where this course comes in. No matter what kind of music you are making, there is a large set of tools that you will need to use.  Each lesson of this course will demonstrate a different set of music production tools, loosely following along the music production process of recording, editing, and mixing. <br><br>We will start with some background on the nature of sound and how we perceive it. We will then examine the components necessary to record audio into a computer, so that you understand the devices that sound must travel through in a music production process. <br>    <br>Once recorded, sound must be organized along a timeline, a process known as editing. It allows us to give the impression of perfect performances and create many of the sounds we hear in contemporary music. The contemporary editing tool is the Digital Audio Workstation (DAW),  a piece of software that stores and organizes all the assets of a musical project. We will focus on the editing tools that are essential in contemporary music production and that all DAWs provide. <br><br>After editing, sounds must be combined or mixed together, so we look to the mixing board—a very creative place if you know how to use it. We will explore the basic functionality of both hardware and software mixing boards, including volume, pan, mute, solo, busses, inserts, sends, and submixes. The mixing process, however, includes more tools than the mixing board provides on its own. Sound must also be processed, modified from its recorded state to fit the context of the music. We will look at compression, equalization, and delay, and examine the many audio effects that are offshoots of these devices and how they are used in a musical context.<br>    <br>We will then explore the synthesizer, a major tool within the production of contemporary music. Yes, great music can and will be created without the synthesizer, but learning how a synthesizer works will give you a language to describe sound. Music is a collaborative art form, so there is nothing more powerful than effective communication. <br>    <br>In the end, the music production process relies on your creativity. Creativity is a product of the mind and will stay there, unexpressed, until the right tools are used in the right way to share it with the world. If you have an idea in your head, it will take numerous steps, each with an important tool, to reach your audience. You bring the dedication and creativity, and this course will bring you the knowledge to make that happen.<br>

Title:  Songwriting
Short desc:  Learn an efficient, effective process for writing songs that express your ideas and emotions, including a range of tools that revolve around the concept of prosody—the matching of lyrics and music to support your underlying message. 
Long desc:  There’s a songwriter lurking somewhere inside you, peeking
around corners, wondering if it’s safe to come out. Now it is. This course is an
invitation to let your inner songwriter step into the sunlight. All it takes is
a simple “yes” and you’ll be climbing that windy hill, marveling at the view.<br><br>If you haven’t written any or many songs, this course will show you
an efficient, effective process for tailoring songs to express your ideas and
emotions. If you have, you’ll look at your process differently, taking control
of aspects of the process you may have not noticed.<br><br>The course will start by examining the tools available to you, all
revolving around the essential concept of <i>prosody</i>. You’ll learn to use your
tools to enhance your message—to work compositionally at the same time you’re
developing your ideas.<br><br>You’ll be working both lyrically and musically, though
musically it’s not necessary that you either read music or play an instrument.
If you play, great, and you’ll be encouraged to play and record your musical
responses to the assignments. If you don’t play, the course offers you a number
of musical loops to work with. All you’ll have to do is sing your melodies over
the loops.<br><br>Assignments will ask you to post something for peer review—sometimes lyric lines or sections, sometimes
melodies, sometimes both. None of it has to be polished. The course is about writing,
not performing.<br><br>Most important, you’ll have a lot of fun.

We will look at basic principles of human-computer interaction, and apply these insights to the design of secure systems with the goal of developing security measures that respect human performance and their goals within a system.
Long desc:  <span><p>In many systems, human users are a critical part of the security process. They create passwords, follow security protocols, and share information that can maintain or destroy the security of a system. However, many secure systems are designed with little to no attention paid to people's cognitive abilities, workflow, or tasks. As a result, people find ways around the security obstacles that get in the way of their work.<br></p><p>This course focuses on how to design and build secure systems with a human-centric focus. We will look at basic principles of human-computer interaction, including the basics of humans' cognitive abilities, principles of usability, design techniques, and evaluation methods. We will then apply these insights to the design of secure systems with the goal of developing security measures that respect human performance and their goals within a system.</p><p>Through hands-on exercises designing, building, evaluating, and critiquing systems, students will learn how to integrate usability into secure software. The course will specifically focus on authentication mechanisms, browsing security, privacy and social media, and mobile security.</p></span>

Title:  The Changing Global Order
Short desc:  This course deals with international relations, peace and security and brings together a number of experts from the field and academia to share their perspectives. The course will help you gain insight into conflict resolution and the role organizations such as the United Nations Security Council, the European Union, the African Union and NATO play in a changing world.
Long desc:  <p>How are international power relations changing and how can global peace and stability be maintained? This course familiarizes you with some main theories of international relations, shows how the global order is gradually changing and discusses how selected
    international and regional organizations contribute to the maintenance of global peace and security. You learn what research findings tell us in terms of the capacity of international organizations and actors to help prevent or stop violent conflict,
    what tools are used to negotiate agreements and how foundations for sustainable peace are best created. In the course, we also focus on the role of the European Union (EU) in terms of diplomacy and efforts to prevent conflict, the North Atlantic Treaty
    Organization (NATO) and the contribution of organizations such as the African Union (AU) to the prevention of conflict and war. We also look at activities of the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) and, in the context of a final debate, see in
    which ways its membership could be adapted to more accurately reflect the power relations of the current global order. You learn about all of these topics by doing quizzes and exercises testing your knowledge of these subjects, helping you understand
    crucial concepts and get insights into how the academic study of international relations and international organization can contribute to the search for global stability and peace in practice.</p>

Title:  Software Security 
Short desc:  In this course we will look at how to build software that is secure. At the conclusion of the course, the student will know how to "build security in" rather than consider it as an afterthought, and will have a plethora of skills, applicable at each phase of the development cycle, that can be used to strengthen the security of software systems.
Long desc:  <span><p>Software is everywhere: in laptops and desktops, mobile phones, the power grid ... even our cars and thermostats. Software is increasingly the vehicle that drives our economy and our personal lives. But software’s pervasiveness, and its importance, make it a target: at the root of many security compromises is vulnerable software.<br></p><p>In this course we will look at how to build software that is secure.</p><p>We will see that security must appear at all phases in the development lifecycle, including requirements development, system design, implementation, testing/validation, and maintenance. To start, we will consider tasks and methods that enhance a software system's design, including threat modeling and attack surface reduction.</p><p>Then we will examine the most prevalent software implementation flaws. At the root of many of these flaws is a failure to mute the influence of untrusted information, and a failure to restrict the flow of private information. We will examine flaws like buffer overruns and double-free's that are present in programs written in low-level programming languages like C and C++. We will also examine flaws, like data races and improper randomness, that can arise in software written any language.

Title:  Hardware Security
Short desc:  In this course, we will study security and trust from the hardware perspective. Upon completing the course, students will understand the vulnerabilities in current digital system design flow and the physical attacks to these systems. They will learn that security starts from hardware design and be familiar with the tools and skills to build secure and trusted hardware.
Long desc:  <span><p>Hardware is the root of computation and communication. It is the enabler of any software, algorithm, or communication protocols. All the computation will eventually be carried out by hardware, namely the processor or the circuits.<br></p><p>In this course, we will study security and trust from the hardware perspective. We will start with a short survey of the roles of hardware in security and trust. With all types of dedicated hardware/circuits, known as co-processors, being developed to speed up application specific computations, hardware’s role changes from the enabler to an enhancer. Nowadays, hardware becomes the enforcer for secure systems because it is used to ensure that only the authenticated user and software can access the processor. However, current hardware design flow does not have security as a key design objective. Consequently, we will conduct several case studies where hardware turns into the weakest link in secure systems. </p><p> </p><p>Then we will review the fundamentals of digital logic design and use this as an example to analyze the source of security vulnerabilities and demonstrate how these vulnerabilities can become legitimate security threats. We conclude with the basic principles and practical methods of design for security and trust, as well as a study of the associated design cost.  </p><p>Next, we introduce physical attacks to popular digital systems such as smart cards and FPGA-based systems. We will focus on side-channel attacks, which have been demonstrated many times to be able to successfully reveal the secret cryptographic keys stored in the secure systems. These attacks include power analysis, timing attacks, and electromagnetic attacks. Standard countermeasures to these attacks will also be introduced.</p><p> </p><p>Finally we will learn the new hardware security primitives that can help us to build secure systems. We will see how the trust platform module (TPM) works; what is a silicon physical unclonable function (PUF) and why it is useful for system security; what is a hardware Trojan horse and the security threats it brings to the system; why counterfeiting becomes a serious problem for hardware design intellectual property protection.</p><p> </p><p>Upon completing the course, students will understand the vulnerabilities in current digital system design flow and the physical attacks to these systems.

Title:  Usable Security
Short desc:  This course focuses on how to design and build secure systems with a human-centric focus. We will look at basic principles of human-computer interaction, and apply these insights to the design of secure systems with the goal of developing security measures that respect human performance and their goals within a system.
Long desc:  <span><p>In many systems, human users are a critical part of the security process. They create passwords, follow security protocols, and share information that can maintain or destroy the security of a system. However, many secure systems are designed with little to no attention paid to people's cognitive abilities, workflow, or tasks. As a result, people find ways around the security obstacles that get in the way of their work.<br></p><p>This course focuses on how to design and build secure systems with a human-centric focus. We will look at basic principles of human-computer interaction, including the basics of humans' cognitive abilities, principles of usability, design techniques, and evaluation methods. We will then apply these insights to the design of secure systems with the goal of developing security measures that respect human performance and their goals within a system.</p><p>Through hands-on exercises designing, building, evaluating, and critiquing systems, students will learn how to integrate usability into secure software. The course will specifically focus on authentication mechanisms, browsing security, privacy and social media, and mobile security.</p></span>

Title:  Design: Creation of Artifacts in Society
Short desc:  Combine fundamental concepts with hands-on design challenges to become a better designer.

Long desc:  This is a course aimed at making you a better designer. The course marries theory and practice, as both are valuable in improving design performance. Lectures and readings will lay out the fundamental concepts that underpin design as a human activity.
Weekly design challenges test your ability to apply those ideas to solve real problems. The course is deliberately broad - spanning all domains of design, including architecture, graphics, services, apparel, engineered goods, and products. The emphasis
of the course is the basic design process: define, explore, select, and refine. You, the student, bring to the course your particular interests and expertise related to, for instance, engineering, furniture, fashion, architecture, or products. In prior
sessions of the course about half of the participants were novices and about half had prior professional design expertise. Both groups seem to benefit substantially from the course. All project work is evaluated by your peers -- and indeed, you will also
be a peer reviewer. This format allows you to see an interesting collection of projects while getting useful feedback on your own project.
<br>
<br><b>Student Testimonials from Earlier Sessions of the Course:</b>
<br>
<span>"An amazing course - a joy to take. I will really miss checking in every
    week to see the latest. I learned a great deal, from the videos, [the course staff] and my fellow
    students. I think getting the feedback from my peers was such a great way
    to run the course. So many ideas, suggestions, thoughts and words of encouragement
    that were so appreciated. I've been driving everyone I know talking about it all the time." &nbsp;--E. Wadsworth-Jones
<br>
<br>"When I signed up for this course I didn't know what to expect; the experience
was so good and rewarding. I just loved it every step of the way. The course
was brilliant, challenging and fun! Our professor, Prof. Karl Ulrich, is
an amazing teacher, I loved his down to Earth approach.  Participating in a tournament was also one of the course's highlights. The whole thing was a great, unforgettable experience. I wish to thank with all my heart Coursera and the University of Pennsylvania for the opportunity given
to us."

Title:  Physique générale - mécanique
Short desc:  À l’École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne, un cours de physique générale fait partie de la formation de tous les futurs ingénieurs et scientifiques. Le présent cours de mécanique en fait partie. Il a pour but de leur apprendre à transcrire sous forme mathématique un phénomène physique, afin de pouvoir en formuler une analyse raisonnée.
Long desc:  <p>La mécanique classique est l’un
des piliers d’une formation polytechnique car elle permet de développer un
savoir-faire en traitant une variété de problèmes du point matériel et du
solide indéformable. On aborde les sujets classiques de la mécanique, comme le
phénomène de résonance, la balistique, le mouvement des planètes autour du
Soleil, et les effets associés aux référentiels accélérés. On cherche à
développer l’habitude de discerner&nbsp; les
limites des modèles&nbsp; qu’on utilise. Dans
cet esprit, on examinera aussi quels étaient les problèmes conceptuels qui ont
conduit à la théorie de la relativité restreinte.</p>

<p>L’accent sera mis sur la
méthodologie&nbsp;: l’étudiant apprendra à traiter rigoureusement un problème
donné, en choisissant judicieusement repère et référentiel et en appliquant la
ou les lois physiques adéquates afin d’obtenir les équations du mouvement.
Puis, il sera amené à discuter ces équations afin d’en tirer une solution
qualitative et/ou quantitative.</p><p></p><p>

</p><p><b>Attention</b> <b>:</b> le cours sera donné en deux sessions
parallèles. L'une aura un rythme particulièrement soutenu de deux leçons par
semaine pendant 12 semaines et correspond au rythme du cours de Physique
Générale I pour physiciens donné à l'EPFL.</p>

<p>Le rythme de la seconde session sera d'une leçon par semaine
pendant 24 semaines, correspondant ainsi à la cadence du cours de Physique
Générale pour les filières d'ingénieurs de l'EPFL. Cependant, cette seconde
session sera mise en pause durant les 8 semaines d'arrêt des cours entre le
semestre d'automne et celui de printemps, à savoir entre le 20 décembre 2013 et
le 17 février 2014.</p>

<p>Pour résumer, la session de 12 semaines (<i>rythme soutenu</i>)
commencera le vendredi 13 septembre et se terminera le 6 décembre. La session
de 24 semaines (<i>rythme normal</i>) commencera également le vendredi 13 septembre,
mais se terminera le 25 avril, avec 8 semaines de pause entre les leçons 14 et
15.</p>

Title:  Malicious Software and its Underground Economy: Two Sides to Every Story
Short desc:  Learn about traditional and mobile malware, the security threats they represent, state-of-the-art analysis and detection techniques, and the underground ecosystem that drives such a profitable but illegal business.
Long desc:  Cybercrime has become both more widespread and harder to battle. Researchers and anecdotal
experience show that the cybercrime scene is becoming increasingly organized
and consolidated, with strong links also to traditional criminal networks.
Modern attacks are indeed stealthy and often profit oriented.

<br><br>Malicious software (malware) is the traditional way in which cybercriminals infect user
and enterprise hosts to gain access to their private, financial, and
intellectual property data. Once stolen, such information can enable more
sophisticated attacks, generate illegal revenue, and allow for cyber-espionage.
<br><br>By mixing a practical, hands-on approach with the theory and techniques behind the scene, the course discusses the current academic and underground research in the
field, trying to answer the foremost question about malware and underground
economy, namely, "Should we care?".<br><br> Students will learn how traditional and mobile malware work, how they are analyzed and
detected, peering through the underground ecosystem that drives this profitable
but illegal business.

Understanding how malware operates is of paramount importance to form knowledgeable experts, teachers, researchers, and practitioners able to fight back.  Besides, it allows us to gather intimate knowledge of the systems and the threats, which is a necessary step to successfully devise novel, effective, and practical mitigation techniques.

Title:  Everything is the Same: Modeling Engineered Systems
Short desc:  This introduction to engineering course will help you learn modeling and analysis techniques for electrical, mechanical, and chemical systems and discover how engineered systems that seem very different are actually very similar.  
Long desc:  Students
 in this class will learn modeling and analysis techniques applicable to
 electrical, mechanical, and chemical systems.  This “systems” view, 
that focuses on what is common to these different physical systems, has 
been responsible for much of the progress in the last several decades in
 aeronautics, robotics, and other engineering disciplines where there 
are many different technologies working together.  <br><br>Starting
 with algebraic descriptions of individual components (such as 
resistors), the class develops tools for modeling engineered systems.  Differential 
equations are key ingredients, so we will spend significant time 
learning how to derive differential equations from component descriptions. 
 One of the key ideas in this class is that electrical, mechanical, and 
chemical systems may seem very different from each other but often have 
very similar behavior, allowing us to draw powerful analogies between 
them.  Case studies from several areas of engineering will be used to 
illustrate the modeling techniques, including examples from robotics, 
power networks, exoskeletons, biomechanics, system identification, and active sensing.  Students will be encouraged to do hands-on 
experiments that demonstrate the techniques.  <br><br>

Title:  General Game Playing
Short desc:  Learn about General Game Playing (GGP) and develop GGP programs capable of competing against humans and other programs in GGP competitions .
Long desc:  General game players are computer systems able to play strategy games
based solely on formal game descriptions supplied at "runtime". &nbsp;(In
other words, they don't know the rules until the game starts.) &nbsp;Unlike
specialized game players, such as Deep Blue, general game players cannot
rely on algorithms designed in advance for specific games; they must discover
such algorithms themselves. &nbsp;General game playing expertise depends
on intelligence on the part of the game player and not just intelligence
of the programmer of the game player.
<br>
<br>
<div>GGP is an interesting application in its own right. &nbsp;It is intellectually
    engaging and more than a little fun. &nbsp;But it is much more than that.
    &nbsp;It provides a theoretical framework for modeling discrete dynamic
    systems and for defining rationality in a way that takes into account problem
    representation and complexities like incompleteness of information and
    resource bounds. &nbsp;It has practical applications in areas where these
    features are important, e.g. in business and law. &nbsp;More fundamentally,
    it raises questions about the nature of intelligence and serves as a laboratory
    in which to evaluate competing approaches to artificial intelligence.</div>
<br>This course is an introduction to General Game Playing (GGP). &nbsp;Students
will get an introduction to the theory of General Game Playing and will&nbsp;learn
how to create GGP programs capable of competing against other programs
and humans.

Title:  Introduction to Logic
Short desc:  In this course, you will learn how to formalize information and reason systematically to produce logical conclusions. We will also examine logic technology and its applications - in mathematics, science, engineering, business, law, and so forth.
Long desc:  <p>Logic is one of the oldest intellectual disciplines in human history.
    It dates back to the times of Aristotle; it has been studied through the
    centuries; and it is still a subject of active investigation today.</p>
<p>This course is a basic introduction to Logic. It shows how to formalize
    information in form of logical sentences. It shows how to reason systematically
    with this information to produce all logical conclusions and only logical
    conclusions. And it examines logic technology and its applications - in
    mathematics, science, engineering, business, law, and so forth.</p>
<p>The course differs from other introductory courses in Logic in two important
    ways. First of all, it teaches a novel theory of logic that improves accessibility
    while preserving rigor. Second, the material is laced with interactive
    demonstrations and exercises that suggest the many practical applications
    of the field.</p>

Title:  Preparation for General Chemistry
Short desc:  The course develops critical thinking and analytic problem solving skills within a chemistry context in order to prepare students for success in college-level General Chemistry—a key gateway class required for many undergraduate majors.
Long desc:  Chemistry is about atoms and molecules and their transformations,
and is referred to as the <i>Central Science</i> because it connects the
physical and life sciences. &nbsp;General Chemistry is your gateway into chemistry, and is
required for majors in just about every field of science, technology and
medicine. &nbsp;General Chemistry trains students to think like scientists
through the application of chemical principles to solve problems.<br><br>College-level general chemistry, however, is extremely
fast-paced, and students are faced with challenges of absorbing new chemistry
concepts at the same time they are applied to complex problems. The goal of
this class is to prepare students for success in General Chemistry by honing
their chemistry problem solving skills. <br><br>In this class, we will review fundamental mathematical
skills, as well as provide strategies for general chemistry problem solving. &nbsp;Focus will be placed on selected conceptual areas of chemistry, and then delve deeply into application of these concepts to solve real-world problems. &nbsp;The class emphasizes critical thinking, solution strategies for complex chemical problems and foundational math skills. &nbsp;A goal of this course is to train students to think like scientists, and prepare them for success in university courses in science, technology engineering and mathematics.<br><br>I hope that you enjoy the class!

Title:  Compilers
Short desc:  This course will discuss the major ideas used today in the implementation of programming language compilers. You will learn how a program written in a high-level language designed for humans is systematically translated into a program written in low-level assembly more suited to machines!
Long desc:  <p>This course will discuss the major ideas used today in the implementation of programming language compilers, including lexical analysis, parsing, syntax-directed translation, abstract syntax trees, types and type checking, intermediate languages, dataflow analysis, program optimization, code generation, and runtime systems. As a result, you will learn how a program written in a high-level language designed for humans is systematically translated into a program written in low-level assembly more suited to machines. Along the way we will also touch on how programming languages are designed, programming language semantics, and why there are so many different kinds of programming languages.</p>
<p>The course lectures will be presented in short videos. To help you master the material, there will be in-lecture questions to answer, quizzes, and two exams: a midterm and a final. There will also be homework in the form of exercises that ask you to show a sequence of logical steps needed to derive a specific result, such as the sequence of steps a type checker would perform to type check a piece of code, or the sequence of steps a parser would perform to parse an input string. This checking technology is the result of ongoing research at Stanford into developing innovative tools for education, and we're excited to be the first course ever to make it available to students.</p>
An optional course project is to write a complete compiler for COOL, the Classroom Object Oriented Language. COOL has the essential features of a realistic programming language, but is small and simple enough that it can be implemented in a few thousand lines of code. Students who choose to do the project can implement it in either C++ or Java.<br>I hope you enjoy the course!
<p><strong>Why Study Compilers?</strong></p>
Everything that computers do is the result of some program, and all of the millions of programs in the world are written in one of the many thousands of programming languages that have been developed over the last 60 years. Designing and implementing a programming language turns out to be difficult; some of the best minds in computer science have thought about the problems involved and contributed beautiful and deep results. Learning something about compilers will show you the interplay of theory and practice in computer science, especially how powerful general ideas combined with engineering insight can lead to practical solutions to very hard problems. Knowing how a compiler works will also make you a better programmer and increase your ability to learn new programming languages quickly.

Title:  Organizational Analysis
Short desc:  In this introductory course, you will learn multiple theories of organizational behavior and apply them to actual cases of organizational change.
Long desc:  It is hard to imagine living in modern society without participating in or interacting with organizations. The ubiquity and variability of organizations means there is ample room for complexity and confusion in the organizational challenges we regularly
face. Through this course, students will consider cases describing various organizational struggles: school systems and politicians attempting to implement education reforms; government administrators dealing with an international crisis; technology firms
trying to create a company ethos that sustains worker commitment; and even two universities trying to gain international standing by performing a merger.
<br>
<br>Each case is full of details and complexity. So how do we make sense of organizations and the challenges they face, let alone develop means of managing them in desired directions? While every detail can matter, some matter more than others. This is why
we rely on organizational theories -- to focus our attention and draw out relevant features in a sensible way.
<br>
<br>Through this course you will come to see that there is nothing more practical than a good theory. Every week, you’ll learn a different organizational theory, and it will become a lens through which you can interpret concrete organizational situations.
Armed with a toolset of theories, you will then be able to systematically identify important features of an organization and the events transforming it – and use the theories to predict which actions will best redirect the organization in a desired direction.<br><br>Join your future classmates and course alumni on&nbsp;<a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/219602578167354/" target="_blank" title="Link: https://www.facebook.com/groups/219602578167354/">Facebook</a>!<br>

Title:  Machine Learning
Short desc:  Learn about the most effective machine learning techniques, and gain practice implementing them and getting them to work for yourself.
Long desc:  <p>Machine learning is the science of getting computers to act without being
    explicitly programmed. In the past decade, machine learning has given us
    self-driving cars, practical speech recognition, effective web search,
    and a vastly improved understanding of the human genome. Machine learning
    is so pervasive today that you probably use it dozens of times a day without
    knowing it. Many researchers also think it is the best way to make progress
    towards human-level AI. In this class, you will learn about the most effective
    machine learning techniques, and gain practice implementing them and getting
    them to work for yourself. More importantly, you'll learn about not only
    the theoretical underpinnings of learning, but also gain the practical
    know-how needed to quickly and powerfully apply these techniques to new
    problems. Finally, you'll learn about some of Silicon Valley's best practices
    in innovation as it pertains to machine learning and AI.</p>
<p>This course provides a broad introduction to machine learning, datamining,
    and statistical pattern recognition. Topics include: (i) Supervised learning
    (parametric/non-parametric algorithms, support vector machines, kernels,
    neural networks). (ii) Unsupervised learning (clustering, dimensionality
    reduction, recommender systems, deep learning). (iii) Best practices in
    machine learning (bias/variance theory; innovation process in machine learning
    and AI). The course will also draw from numerous case studies and applications,
    so that you'll also learn how to apply learning algorithms to building
    smart robots (perception, control), text understanding (web search, anti-spam),
    computer vision, medical informatics, audio, database mining, and other
    areas.</p>

Long desc:  <p>The average American is now at least three generations
removed from production agriculture. 
This leads to the disconnection between how the public views agriculture
and how scientists and producers view it, resulting in consumer distrust of

Title:  Inspiring Leadership through Emotional Intelligence
Short desc:  Emotional intelligence, hope, mindfulness, and compassion help a person reverse the damage of chronic stress and build great leadership relationships. The Positive and Negative Emotional Attractors inspire sustained, desired change and learning at many levels. 
Long desc:  <p>Great leaders move us through our emotions. They establish a deep emotional
    connection with others called resonance. Their own levels of emotional
    intelligence allow them to create and nurture these resonant relationships.
    They use their EI as a path to resonant leadership through mindfulness,
    hope, compassion, and playfulness. Unfortunately, most people in leadership
    and helping positions (i.e., doctors, teachers, coaches, etc.) lose their
    effectiveness over time because of the cumulative damage from chronic stress.
    But humans can renew themselves, neurologically, hormonally, and emotionally.</p>
<p>Based on decades of&nbsp;research into emotional intelligence&nbsp;competencies
    and longitudinal studies of their development, the course will examine
    resonance and developing "resonant leadership" capability,&nbsp;emotional
    intelligence, and the experiences of mindfulness, hope, and compassion.
    Using the latest in neuroscience, behavioral, organizational and psychological
    research, participants will&nbsp;understand the theory, research, and experience
    of the Positive Emotional Attractor that is an essential beginning to sustained,
    desired change for individuals, teams, organizations and communities.&nbsp;</p><p>The course will consist of nine classes, with three or so
modules per class, to be taken over 8 weeks. Each module will consist of a
video, assigned and recommended readings, reflective exercises, writing in your
Personal Journal, and on-line, asynchronous discussions. Each class will have personal
learning assignments to use and tests of comprehension.&nbsp;</p>

Title:  Massively Multivariable Open Online Calculus Course
Short desc:  M2O2C2 provides a first taste of multivariable differential calculus.
By introducing the machinery of linear algebra, this course provides helpful tools for understanding the derivative of a function of many variables.
Long desc:  M2O2C2 is an invitation to think carefully about how one thing changing&nbsp;affects something else. What is the "derivative" of a function of many&nbsp;variables? How can a curved object be approximated by a flat plane? What&nbsp;does the chain rule look like when many things are affecting many other&nbsp;things? How do we find an input which maximizes a function of many&nbsp;variables?<br><br>This is a first course in multivariable differential calculus, but along&nbsp;the way, we will also introduce a ton of linear algebra. The result is a&nbsp;course targeted at a student who has seen a bit of calculus and who is&nbsp;willing to learn about linear transformations&nbsp;and vectors; such a&nbsp;student will have the best possible vantage point from which to explore&nbsp;derivatives of functions of many variables.

Title:  Machine Learning
Short desc:  Learn about the most effective machine learning techniques, and gain practice implementing them and getting them to work for yourself.
Long desc:  <p>Machine learning is the science of getting computers to act without being
    explicitly programmed. In the past decade, machine learning has given us
    self-driving cars, practical speech recognition, effective web search,
    and a vastly improved understanding of the human genome. Machine learning
    is so pervasive today that you probably use it dozens of times a day without
    knowing it. Many researchers also think it is the best way to make progress
    towards human-level AI. In this class, you will learn about the most effective

Title:  History of Rock, Part One
Short desc:  Learn about the early days of rock music, from the pre-rock years of the post World War II era through the birth of rock in the mid 1950s to the psychedelic era of the late 1960s.
Long desc:  This course, part 1 of a 2-course sequence, examines the&nbsp;history of rock, primarily&nbsp;as it unfolded in the United States,&nbsp;from the days before rock (pre-1955) to the end of the 1960s. This course covers the music of Elvis Presley, Chuck Berry, Phil Spector,&nbsp;Bob Dylan, the Beatles, the Rolling Stones, Jimi Hendrix, Cream, and many more artists, with an emphasis both on cultural context and on the music itself. We will also explore how developments in&nbsp;the music business and in technology helped shape the ways in which styles developed.&nbsp;<br><br>Rock emerged in the mid 1950s as a blending of mainstream pop, rhythm and blues, and country and western--styles that previously&nbsp;had remained relatively separate. This new style became the music of the emerging youth culture and was often associated with teen rebellion. We will follow the story of how this rowdy first wave of rock and roll (1955-59) was tamed in the early 60s but came roaring back with the Beatles and the Rolling Stones and then went psychedelic&nbsp;by the end of the decade.

Title:  The Bible's Prehistory, Purpose, and Political Future
Short desc:  How and why was the Bible written? Drawing on the latest archeological research and a wide range of comparative texts, this course synthesizes fascinating recent research in biblical studies and presents a powerful new thesis: Facing catastrophic defeat, the biblical authors created a new form of community—what today we would call "peoplehood." Their achievements bear directly on modern questions of politics, economics, and theology.
Long desc:  With its walls razed to ground by Babylon’s armies, Jerusalem joined a long line of ancient vanquished cities—from Ur and Nineveh and Persepolis to Babylon itself. While some recovered from the destruction, others did not.  But none responded to political catastrophe by fashioning the kind of elaborate and enduring monument to their own downfall that we find in the Bible. Most conquered populations viewed their subjugation as a source of shame. They consigned it to oblivion, opting instead to extol the golden ages of the past.  The biblical authors in contrast reacted to loss by composing extensive writings that acknowledge collective failure, reflect deeply upon its causes, and discover thereby a ground for collective hope.  <br> <br>Working through colorful biblical and ancient Near Eastern texts, and drawing on an array of comparative examples, the course illustrates the thoroughgoing manner with which biblical authors responded to defeat by advancing a demotic agenda that places the community at the center. The aim of the biblical authors was to create a nation, and they sought to realize this goal via a shared text, which includes stories and songs, wisdom and laws. This corpus of writings belongs, without a doubt, to humanity’s greatest achievements. Whereas the great civilizations of the Near East invested their energies and resources into monuments of stone that could be destroyed by invading armies, the biblical authors left a literary legacy that has been intensively studied until the present day. More important, these authors’ visionary response to defeat brought to light a radical new wisdom:  the notion that a people is greater than the state which governs it, and that a community can survive collapse when all of its members can claim a piece of the pie and therefore have a reason to take an active part in its collective life. <br> <br>The objectives of the course are to show: <br>—how biblical scholars work with archeological and comparative texts to study the Bible's formation;<br>—how the Bible emerged from large-scale corporate crisis and rupture;<br>—that in our present state of uncertainty and instability we have much to learn from the various strategies the biblical authors adopted to create an enduring “people of the book”;<br>—that one doesn’t have to believe in God or accept the historicity of the Bible in order to appreciate its profound political messages;<br>—that the Bible offers modern societies a model for creating communities around a shared collection of texts, songs, and laws;<br>—and that the Bible itself has a major role to play in our futures.<br>

Title:  The Art and Archaeology of Ancient Nubia
Short desc:  This course examines the development of the art and architecture of the cultures of ancient Nubia through what we have learned from archaeology and how that evidence has helped us create the picture we now have of the culture and history of the birth and development of art and civilization in the Nile Valley. 
Long desc:  The
class will reveal one of the most dynamic, yet little known cultures of the ancient
world.  We will explore the geography and
archaeology of Nubia, Egypt’s neighbor to the south and home to a series of
remarkable and innovative civilizations. It will cover the period from the earliest inhabitants of the Nile
Valley (Paleolithic through Neolithic and domestication of plants and animals),
and continue until the advent of Christianity. <br><br>

Title:  Cryptography I
Short desc:  Learn about the inner workings of cryptographic primitives and how to apply this knowledge in real-world applications!
Long desc:  <p>Cryptography is an indispensable tool for protecting information in computer systems. This course explains the inner workings of cryptographic primitives and how to correctly use them. Students will learn how to reason about the security of cryptographic constructions and how to apply this knowledge to real-world applications. The course begins with a detailed discussion of how two parties who have a shared secret key can communicate securely when a powerful adversary eavesdrops and tampers with traffic. We will examine many deployed protocols and analyze mistakes in existing systems. The second half of the course discusses public-key techniques that let two or more parties generate a shared secret key. We will cover the relevant number theory and discuss public-key encryption and basic key-exchange.&nbsp;Throughout the course students will be exposed to many exciting open problems in the field.</p>
<p>The course will include written homeworks and programming labs. The course is self-contained, however it will be helpful to have a basic understanding of discrete probability theory.</p>

Long desc:  <p>Public
Mental Health is the application of the principles of medicine and social
science to prevent the occurrence of mental and behavioral disorders and to
promote mental health of the population. This course illustrates the principles of public health applied to
depressive disorder, including principles of epidemiology, transcultural
psychiatry, health services research, and prevention. It is predicted that by 2020 depressive disorder will be the
most important cause of disease burden in the entire world!  Every human being suffers from feeling
depressed at some point or other, but only about one fifth of the population
will experience an episode of depressive disorder over the course of their
lives. This course
illuminates the public health approach to disease, and the particular
complexities of applying this approach to mental disorders, using depression as
the exemplar.  </p>

Title:  Wheels of Metals: the Global Metals Challenge
Short desc:  Population and welfare are growing and the global supply of metals is a major challenge. Only with reuse and recycling will metals be available in sufficient quantities. We will explore the conditions and consequences of closed loop economies for metals, based on the reports of UNEP's International Resource Panel.
Long desc:  <p>Metals are present everywhere around us and are major materials upon which our economies are built. Economic development is
deeply coupled with the use of metals. During the 20th century the variety of
metal applications in society grew rapidly. In addition to mass applications
such as steel in buildings and aluminium in airplanes, more and more 
metals are in use for innovative technologies such as the use of the specialty
metal indium in LCD screens.&nbsp; </p>

In particular in emerging economies, but also in
industrialized countries, the demand for metals is rapidly increasing. Mining
activities expand, but&nbsp;easily accessible&nbsp;deposits are becoming scarce and recycling is
inevitable. This “mining above ground” or “urban mining” is of increasing
importance in generating raw materials.
The continued increase in the use of metals over the 20th century has
led to a substantial shift in metal stocks from below ground to above ground in
applications in society. Such a shift raises social, economic, and
environmental issues. To&nbsp;address these issues, information is needed on the amount of
metal stocks in society and their lifetimes. This course, based on the reports
of the Global Metals Flows Group of UNEP’s Resource Panel, will explore the
conditions and the consequences of closed loop economies for metals.

This course aims at empowering you, your family, business and community in Europe and beyond and will enable you to discover jobs you were not aware of. Des sous-titres seront proposés en français.
Long desc:  <p>Regardless of where you live, the European Union has a large, yet often unnoticed, impact on many aspects of your everyday life. Whether you are traveling, eating, working, doing business, shopping, surfing the Internet or breathing, all these activities are largely shaped by the EU.  As a result no global citizen, business leader, lawmaker, lobbyist or student can effectively operate in Europe or in the world without a solid understanding of this unique laboratory of integration. While the EU is often depicted as a monstrous bureaucratic creature, condemned to irrelevance by the emerging economies, it remains the most accomplished experiment of economic, social and political integration in human history. In 50 years the EU accomplished what other countries took centuries to realize.</p><p>Given its inherent complexities, <b>Understanding Europe</b> aims at popularizing the intricacies of the European Union system to <i>promote greater awareness of the opportunities it offers you</i>. Ultimately, you will not only better grasp the applicable framework for any European economic or social activity you engage in, but <i>you will also participate on the EU stage</i>. By confronting you with several current EU policy proposals, you will be able to ‘have a say’ in the EU policymaking process. We want to empower you as a citizen and business operator to maximize your rights and opportunities in today’s Europe.</p><p><b>Understanding Europe</b> is structured upon some basic yet critical questions about the EU’s purpose and legitimacy : why does the EU exist? How does it work? What can it offer you? The course then analyzes the European public sphere by focusing on its main actors (the European Parliament, the Commission, the Council, the Court of Justice of the EU) and the role European citizens play in influencing Europe. We then move to the Union’s powers (what can the EU do? How far can it go? Do Members States have some instruments to “block” EU action? Can EU citizens challenge EU action?) by discussing the limits to its action and describing some of its policies. The course then analyzes the role and opportunities citizens and all stakeholders may have in shaping EU policies through public consultation, the European Citizens Initiative and other forms of participatory democracy. In a further step, we will analyze what the EU is doing for you regardless of where you are based in the world. Finally, by taking stock of what you have learned in the previous weeks, we will look at what you can do for and in Europe.<br></p><p>Throughout the whole course, participants will be confronted with real-life examples of EU action. EU affairs professionals will share their personal EU experiences and tell us about their EU jobs. You can interact with the instructor and other participants, share your opinions, question the instructor’s assumptions and hence shape the course’s content. </p>

Title:  Çok Değişkenli Fonksiyonlarda Türev ve Entegral I: Temel Kavram ve Yöntemler / Multivariable Calculus I: Fundamental Concepts and Basic Techniques
Short desc:  Ders çok değişkenli fonksiyonlardaki ikili dizinin birincisidir. Burada çok değişkenli fonksiyonlardaki temel türev ve entegral kavramlarını geliştirmek ve bu konulardaki problemleri çözmekteki temel yöntemleri sunmaktadır. Ders gerçek yaşamdan gelen uygulamaları da tanıtmaya önem veren “içerikli yaklaşımla” tasarlanmıştır.
Long desc:  <p><b>Türkçe<br></b>Ders çok değişkenli fonksiyonlardaki
ikili dizinin birincisidir. Burada çok değişkenli fonksiyonlardaki temel türev
ve entegral kavramlarını geliştirmek ve bu konulardaki problemleri çözmekteki
temel yöntemleri sunmaktadır. Ders gerçek yaşamdan gelen uygulamaları da
tanıtmaya önem veren “içerikli yaklaşımla” tasarlanmıştır.</p>

<p>Konuların sunumunda “ne?” ve “nasıl?” sorularının yanısı sıra, “neden?” ve
“nerede?” sorularına da yanıt aranacaktır. İlk iki soru “tanım” ve “kanıt”ları
oluşturuyor. Diğer iki soru da, konuların nereden geldiğini ve nerede
kullanılacağına yanıt veriyor.</p><p>Matematikte konuları bir düzen içinde hazır cevaplar vererek geliştirmek
(Aristo yöntemi) önemlidir. Bunun yanı sıra sorular sorup, öğrenciyle birlikte
yanıtlamak da öğrenim için etkin bir yöntem (Sokrat yöntemi). Buradaki sunumda
uygun durumlarda Sokrat yönteminden yararlanmaya özen gösterilmektedir.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Niçin türev ve entegral? Yaşamın iki önemli göstergesi değişim ve
birikimdir. Değişim farklarla ve birikim de toplamalarla tanımlanır. Özünde,
diferansiyel hesap, ilkokuldan beri öğrenip uyguladığımız çıkarma ve toplama
işlemlerinin bir uzantısıdır. Diferansiyel hesaptaki yeni kavram anlık değişim
ve değişken girdilerden oluşan birikimin belirlenebilmesidir. Bu iki kavram
sonsuz küçük değerleri gerektirir. İstenen anlık değişiklik ve birikim sonsuz
küçüklerin sıfır olduğu limitte ulaşılan değerlerdir. Limit diferansiyel
hesabın dayandığı temel kavramdır.</p>

<p>Bir fonksiyon, bir girdi (bağımsız değişken) ile çıktı (bağımlı değişken)
arasındaki ilişkidir. Bağımlı değişkendeki değişimin, bağımsız değişkendeki
değişime oranı “türev” kavramını getirir. Birikim de, örneğin kütleyi, elektrik
yükünü, enerjiyi, uzunluğu, alanı, hacmi veren fonksiyonların bağımsız
değişkendeki sonsuz küçük değerlerle ağırlıklı toplamıdır. Bu işlem “entegral”
kavramıdır. İlkokuldan beri toplama ve çıkarmanın birbirinin tersi ve
tamamlayıcısı olduğunu biliyor ve kullanıyoruz. Bu ilişki türev ve entegralde
de geçerlidir. Diferansiyel hesabın iki “temel teoremi” bu ilişkiyi kanıtlar:
Bir fonksiyonun türevinin entegrali, başlangıçtaki fonksiyonu verir. Benzer
olarak, bir fonksiyonun entegralinin türevi de başlangıçtaki fonksiyonu verir.
Bu temel sonuçlar “Tek değişkenli fonksiyonların diferansiyel hesabı” dersinden
biliniyor. Bu ders aynı konuları temel alarak, kavram ve hesaplama yöntemlerini
çok değişkenli fonksiyonlara geliştiriyor.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Niçin çok değişkenli fonksiyonlar? Çünkü yaşamın gerçek konuları bir, iki
veya üç konum ve bir de zaman değişkeniyle belirleniyor. Ders tek değişkenli
fonksiyonlarda öğrendiklerimizin üzerine yapılanıyor. Her yeni konuya
başlarken, tek değişkenli fonksiyonlardaki eşdeğer durum hatırlatılacaktır. Bu
nedenle önceki dersin konularını hatırlatma, öğrenciye eksik bildiklerini
tamamlama ve bildiklerini pekiştirme olanağını da veriyor. Dersin sonunda
öğrenciler çok boyutta düşünebilme becerisini geliştirecek, çevreyi ve insan
yapısı olan teknolojiyi gerçekçi anlamda kavrayabilecektir.&nbsp;</p>

<b>English<br></b></span>The course is the first of the sequence of calculus of multivariable
functions. It develops the fundamental concepts of derivatives and integrals of
functions of several variables, and the basic tools for doing the relevant
calculations. The course is designed with a “content-based” approach, i. e. by
solving examples, as many as possible from real life situations.&nbsp;</p><p>The “why” and
“where“ of the topics are discussed, as much as the “what” and the “how”. The
answers to the latter are the “definitions” and “proofs”, while the answers to
the first two tell the reason for studying a topic, and the areas where such
ideas are used.</p>

<p>The transfer of knowledge through an organized deductive process plays an
important role in mathematics (Aristotelian approach). An interactive
communication between the teacher and the student through posing questions and
answering them leads to an effective method (Socratian method). The design of this
course will benefit from the latter whenever feasible.</p>

<p>Why do we study derivatives and integrals? Because derivatives express
change, and integrals define the cumulative results of many inputs. Change and
growth through time or space are two basic aspects of life. Change is expressed
with the difference between two situations, and the cumulative result of many
inputs is an additive process. Thus basically, calculus is an extension of what
we all learn as early as first grade as addition and subtraction. Calculus
enables us to define and calculate instantaneous changes and growth by
continuously varying inputs. Instantaneity of the changes and variability of
the inputs are handled by infinitesimal quantities. The final results are
obtained in the limit where the infinitesimal changes become zero. The limit is
the central concept of calculus.</p>

<p>A function defines the relationship between the inputs, which are the
independent variables, and outputs which are the dependent variables. The ratio
of the infinitesimal changes in the dependent variable to those of the
independent variable leads to the concept of the “derivative”. Similarly, the
cumulative outputs of entities such as matter, energy, area, surface, volume,
etc. are calculated by the sum of the dependent variable weighted by the
changes in the independent variable. This operation leads to the concept of
“integral”. Just like in Grade One, where we observed that addition and
subtraction are the inverses of each other, so are integral and derivative. This
complementarity between the derivative and integral is expressed by the two
“fundamental theorems of calculus”. All this is studied in the “Calculus of
Single Variable Functions”.</p>

<p>Why multivariables? Because real life problems involve several variables.
Our environment is defined by three space variables and phenomena evolve in
terms of a fourth which is time. People- made phenomena require many more
variables. The course offered here is built on the knowledge of calculus of
single variable functions and extends the concepts and techniques to
multivariable functions. The concepts and techniques are, in most cases,
natural extensions and generalizations from those in single variable functions.
Hence, each topic will start the review of the fundamental concepts and
calculation techniques from the calculus of one variable functions. This review
is an opportunity to supplement what a student missed in the earlier course on
single variables, while advancing into relevant problems from real life that
involve more than one variable.</p>

Title:  Competitive Strategy
Short desc:  In this six-modules course you will learn how firms behave in situations in which strategic decisions are interdependent, i.e. where my actions affect my competitors' profits and vice versa. Using the basic tools of game theory, we will analyze how firms choose strategies to attain competitive advantage. 
Long desc:  <p>This course
is about the behavior of companies in
competitive markets. Facing competition forces firms to look ahead and
anticipate developments: If my rivals are likely
to react to a price cut, I will have to take the expected reaction into account.
We focus on such instances of “strategic
interdependencies” in real business situations. <br></p><p>We will first study the basic concepts of game theory as a toolbox with which we will
then analyze strategic “games” in real-life settings. Rather than a set
of checklists of “how-to-behave” in a number of
prespecified situations, this course will teach you to think about business
strategy in a systematic and exciting - and
ultimately more successful - way!</p>

We will use our toolbox to
address and analyze different decisions firms take: How do price wars happen and when do they end? When should I
enter a market in which firms currently make high profits? What makes strategic
partnerships work? These are just some examples of the questions we will
discuss during the course. By the end of the course, you should be able to
apply the concepts to pretty much any business situation.<br><br>This course is complemented by <a target="_blank" href="https://www.coursera.org/course/advcompstrategy">Advanced Competitive Strategy</a>.<br>

Title:  Climate Change
Short desc:  This course develops an interdisciplinary understanding of the social, political, economic and scientific perspectives on climate change.
Long desc:  <p></p><p><b></b>What is Climate Change? How should we respond to
Climate Change? These questions are complex, not least because the responses
available to us depend upon who is providing the answers and the particular
perspective they take. The economist sees the economic challenges and
opportunities of Climate Change; the scientist sees the need to describe and
explain Climate Change; the policy-maker and social scientist
see Climate Change as a social problem. Therefore, the first step to
understanding Climate Change and what we do about it is to see how experts from
different disciplines engage with the issue. The second step is to appreciate how
our response to Climate Change depends upon the interplay between these
different approaches.</p>

<p>This course offers you an introduction to different
disciplinary perspectives on Climate Change to help you think about how Climate Change
affects you as an individual, as a member of your local community, as a citizen
of your country and as a member of the global community. We have designed the
presentations, discussions, activities and assessment tasks in this course to
help you understand what Climate Change is and what you – and we – should do about it.</p>

Title:  Functional Programming Principles in Scala
Short desc:  Learn about functional programming, and how it can be effectively combined with object-oriented programming. Gain practice in writing clean functional code, using the Scala programming language.
Long desc:  This course introduces the cornerstones of functional programming using the Scala programming language. Functional programming has become more and more popular in recent years because it promotes code that’s safe, concise, and elegant. Furthermore, functional programming makes it easier to write parallel code for today’s and tomorrow’s multiprocessors by replacing mutable variables and loops with powerful ways to define and compose functions. <br><br> Scala is a language that fuses functional and object-oriented programming in a practical package. It interoperates seamlessly with Java and its tools. Scala is now used in a rapidly increasing number of open source projects and companies. It provides the core infrastructure for sites such as Twitter, LinkedIn, Foursquare, Tumblr, and Klout. <br><br> In this course you will discover the elements of the functional programming style and learn how to apply them usefully in your daily programming tasks. You will also develop a solid foundation for reasoning about functional programs, by touching upon proofs of invariants and the tracing of execution symbolically. <br><br> The course is hands on; most units introduce short programs that serve as illustrations of important concepts and invite you to play with them, modifying and improving them. The course is complemented by a series of assignments, most of which are also programming projects.

Title:  Les problèmes métaphysiques à l’épreuve de la politique, 1943-1968
Short desc:  L'objet de ce cours est d'étudier l'articulation entre les prises de position et les théories politiques des philosophes français du XXème siècle et leur philosophie fondamentale, voire leur métaphysique. Le parcours proposé sollicite l'étude de textes entre autres de Sartre, Merleau-Ponty, Cavaillès, Weil, Levi-Strauss, Althusser, Foucault, Deleuze, Lévinas, Derrida...

Long desc:  <span>La
philosophie française contemporaine ne se laisse pas penser indépendamment de
l’engagement politique de philosophes (Sartre, Merleau-Ponty, Camus, Althusser,
Levi-Strauss, Foucault, Deleuze, Derrida, Levinas, parmi d’autres)  qui en ont écrit l’histoire. La guerre et la
paix, le communisme et la décolonisation, la violence et le pouvoir sont autant
de questions, dont l’analyse et la discussion n’ont jamais cessé de ponctuer
leur travail. Mais si ces prises de position « politiques » doivent
être également tenues pour « philosophiques », c’est parce qu’elles  sont indissociables  du travail proprement théorique, et des
problèmes métaphysiques qu’elles impliquent, 
tels qu’ils sont traités dans les œuvres majeures  de ces philosophes, et dans les débats qui
les ont opposés, dessinant les moments centraux du siècle, trop vite figés dans
« l’existentialisme » ou le « structuralisme ». Le parti
pris de ce cours est donc de revenir, au-delà des clichés qui les masquent, et
en les éclairant l’un par l’autre, à l’articulation de ces « engagements
politiques » et de ces « problèmes métaphysiques ».</span>

Title:  Social Entrepreneurship
Short desc:  In this course you will learn how to create societal impact through Social Entrepreneurship (S-ENT). S-ENT describes the discovery and sustainable exploitation of opportunities to create social change.  The course introduces you to practical S-ENT examples as well as the foundational literature.
Long desc:  <p>The domain of social change is no longer reserved for students of political sciences and development studies. Increasingly business students are recognized as possessing important skills that can drive social change. This new discipline is often referred to as Social Entrepreneurship (S-ENT). S-ENT describes the discovery and sustainable exploitation of opportunities to create public goods. This is usually done through the generation of disequilibria in market and non-market environments. The S-ENT process can in some cases lead to the creation of social enterprises. These social ventures are hybrid organizations exhibiting characteristics of both the for-profit and not-for-profit sector. Individuals engaging in S-ENT are usually referred to as social entrepreneurs, a term that describes resourceful individuals working to create social innovation. They do not only have to identify (or create) opportunities for social change (that so far have been unexploited), they must also muster the resources necessary to turn these opportunities into reality.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A typical example is Prof. Muhammad Yunus, founder of the Grameen Bank (Bangladesh) and recipient of the Nobel Peace prize in recognition of his contribution to poverty alleviation through the invention and popularization of Microfinance. Other examples include fair trade or car-sharing. Today many foundations aim to identify and promote social entrepreneurs. Two prominent examples are Ashoka and the Skoll Foundation. So called venture philanthropists adopt methods from the domain of venture capital, for example, encouraging social entrepreneurs to provide detailed business plans and to measure and report systematically on their social performance. Social Return on Investment (S-ROI) analysis is an example, of an emerging tool aiming to describe the social impact of S-ENT in dollar terms, relative to the philanthropic investment made.</p>

Title:  Growing Old Around the Globe
Short desc:  The world is ageing – people are older and societies are facing hard realities.  What are we to make our lives in this time of global ageing? In six weeks, we analyze critical questions about age and ageing around the world.
Long desc:  <p>Growing old is discussed today in ominous terms – concerns about disease,
    dysfunction, and destitution are daily discussed by media and policy makers.
    What are individuals, families, communities and societies to make of an
    ageing world? We analyze contemporary topics in psychological and social
    ageing from a global perspective. Each week, we pose a question to be explored
    and discussed online. Participants are encouraged to contribute their experiences
    and perspectives as we create a global community to discuss age, ageing,
    and the science of gerontology in action. Participants will then compile
    a portfolio of materials they create and/or collect to address each week’s
    question and critically reflect their knowledge and experience throughout
    the course. Portfolios are then reviewed by peers at the end of the course
    to foster continued discourse among participants in our COURSERA community.</p>

Title:  An Introduction to Marketing
Short desc:  This Wharton course will teach the fundamentals of marketing by getting to the root of customer decision making. The course will focus on branding strategies, customer centricity and new market entry.
Long desc:  <p><b>PART OF THE WHARTON FOUNDATION SERIES</b> 
</p>
<p></p>
<p>This course is part of the Wharton foundation series in the MOOC format. It is taught by three of Wharton's top faculty in the marketing department, which is consistently ranked as the #1 marketing department in the world. This course features on-location
    videos and debates between the three professors.</p>
<p>The three core topics focus on customer loyalty. The first is about branding: given a very disparate world in which new startups are emerging constantly, brand equity is one of the key elements of keeping customers so that they have a trusted source for
    their needs. The second topic is customer centricity, which is taught in a global context where students learn how to gather needs and focus on the customer via discussion forums and empirical examples which are advanced by the mix of cultures in
    the course. Finally, the course explores practical, go-to-market strategies to help students understand the drivers that influence customers and see how these are implemented prior to making an investment.</p>

    very little background knowledge in statistics and introduces new concepts
    with several fun and easy to understand examples. </p>
<p>This course is, quite literally, for everyone. If you think you can't
    learn statistics, this course is for you. If you had a statistics course
    before but feel like you need a refresher, this course is for you. Even
    if you are a relatively advanced researcher or analyst, this course provides
    a foundation and a context that helps to put one’s work into perspective.</p>
<p>Statistics One also provides an introduction to the R programming language.
    All the examples and assignments will involve writing code in R and interpreting
    R output. R software is free! What this means is you can download R, take
    this course, and start programming in R after just a few lectures. That
    said, this course is not a comprehensive guide to R or to programming in
    general. </p>

Title:  Teaching Character and Creating Positive Classrooms 
Short desc:  Positive psychology meets K-12 pedagogy. This course explores key ideas of positive psychology and shows how great teachers apply those lessons to maximize student engagement and accomplishment.  Through lectures, discussions, interviews and footage of great educators in action, you’ll learn how to integrate character-based objectives into your own teaching.
Long desc:  Psychology, sociology, and neuroscience point to the existence of a set
of developable character strengths that serve as building blocks for positive
life outcomes. That’s why, in our view, character development and content
mastery act as the two complementary halves of remarkable teaching. But
they’re often perceived to be in competition. When you ask parents about
their goals for their children, they almost always respond with terms like,
<i>“successful,” “happy,”
“curious,”</i> and <i>“being kind to others.”</i> But when you ask schools
about their goals, they often reply in terms of academic content, like <i>“algebra,” “subject-verb
agreement,”</i> and <i>“the periodic table.”</i> 
<br>
<br>Great teachers have always united those two visions.
<br>
<br>This course explores the interconnection between character research, education,
and academic rigor. During our sessions, we’ll cover the field of positive
psychology as it relates to character strengths, as well as the concepts
of Growth Mindset, Constructive Responding, and Character Behavior Language.
We will engage with the existing research, hear from eminent scholars in
the field and top K-12 educators, and view footage of classroom teachers
integrating these ideas into their classroom instruction.
<br>
<br>The course will explore questions like:
<span>
<br>
<br></span>
<ol>
    <li>How can positive psychology help us maximize student engagement and accomplishment?</li>
    <li>What does it look like to implement a <i>growth mindset</i> in your classroom?</li>
    <li>Can you teach <i>grit</i> in the classroom? If so, how?</li>
    <li>Should an educator measure character? If so, how?
        <br>

    <br>
    <br>In the weeks leading up to the 50th anniversary of the assassination, this course will explore the Presidency, assassination, and lasting legacy of President John F. Kennedy. Students will learn how 
    JFK’s life, administration, and tragic death have influenced the general public, the media, and each of the nine U.S. presidents who followed.<br><br>Understanding the Kennedy legacy
    and being able to identify elements of his legacy within the context of modern politics&nbsp;helps understand&nbsp;many of the&nbsp;vexing problems that developed over the last half century as well as many of the challenges that confront us today.&nbsp;
    &nbsp;
    <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>November 22, 1963 was so powerful a moment that in the fifty years since the assassination, every U.S. President that followed JFK has used Kennedy’s words and actions in an effort to craft their own political image. Why does Kennedy’s influence persist,
    and will it continue? What are the effects?
    <br>
    <br>We’ll address these questions and more as we explore The Kennedy Half Century.

Title:  Introduction to Music Production
Short desc:  Learn about the music production process—including recording, editing, and mixing—and the tools available to you to create contemporary music on your computer. 
Long desc:  With the recent introduction of high-quality-low-cost software and hardware, the tools of music production are now available to the masses. Albums are made in bedrooms as well as studios. On the surface this is liberating. Anyone can make an album for the low cost of a couple pieces of gear and a software package. But, if you dig deeper, you will find that it is not so easy. Producing music requires knowledge, <b></b>dedication, and creativity.<br>    <br>Knowledge is where this course comes in. No matter what kind of music you are making, there is a large set of tools that you will need to use.  Each lesson of this course will demonstrate a different set of music production tools, loosely following along the music production process of recording, editing, and mixing. <br><br>We will start with some background on the nature of sound and how we perceive it. We will then examine the components necessary to record audio into a computer, so that you understand the devices that sound must travel through in a music production process. <br>    <br>Once recorded, sound must be organized along a timeline, a process known as editing. It allows us to give the impression of perfect performances and create many of the sounds we hear in contemporary music. The contemporary editing tool is the Digital Audio Workstation (DAW),  a piece of software that stores and organizes all the assets of a musical project. We will focus on the editing tools that are essential in contemporary music production and that all DAWs provide. <br><br>After editing, sounds must be combined or mixed together, so we look to the mixing board—a very creative place if you know how to use it. We will explore the basic functionality of both hardware and software mixing boards, including volume, pan, mute, solo, busses, inserts, sends, and submixes. The mixing process, however, includes more tools than the mixing board provides on its own. Sound must also be processed, modified from its recorded state to fit the context of the music. We will look at compression, equalization, and delay, and examine the many audio effects that are offshoots of these devices and how they are used in a musical context.<br>    <br>We will then explore the synthesizer, a major tool within the production of contemporary music. Yes, great music can and will be created without the synthesizer, but learning how a synthesizer works will give you a language to describe sound. Music is a collaborative art form, so there is nothing more powerful than effective communication. <br>    <br>In the end, the music production process relies on your creativity. Creativity is a product of the mind and will stay there, unexpressed, until the right tools are used in the right way to share it with the world. If you have an idea in your head, it will take numerous steps, each with an important tool, to reach your audience. You bring the dedication and creativity, and this course will bring you the knowledge to make that happen.<br>

Title:  Jazz Improvisation
Short desc:  Learn the basic concepts of improvisation from Gary Burton, one of the most renowned improvisers in the jazz world, including the mental, melodic, and harmonic processes that contribute to the instinctive skills that an improviser puts to use when taking a solo.
Long desc:  While many people are fans of
jazz and understand that musicians are often “making up” the
notes they are playing during a performance, most people—often
including musicians, themselves, who are beginning to learn improvising—aren’t
clear about what exact processes take place to enable this to happen. The
purpose of this course is to introduce the basic concepts of modern improvisation and
how to go about mastering the different musical and mental skills involved. <br><br>Course author Gary Burton codifies a sought-after approach to improvisation that has been at the 
core of Berklee College of Music's curriculum for decades. Students who complete
this course will know what to practice and how to practice the
various aspects of improvising, in addition to understanding how the improviser spontaneously
communicates to the listeners through their musical creations.

Title:  Songwriting
Short desc:  Learn an efficient, effective process for writing songs that express your ideas and emotions, including a range of tools that revolve around the concept of prosody—the matching of lyrics and music to support your underlying message. 
Long desc:  There’s a songwriter lurking somewhere inside you, peeking
around corners, wondering if it’s safe to come out. Now it is. This course is an
invitation to let your inner songwriter step into the sunlight. All it takes is
a simple “yes” and you’ll be climbing that windy hill, marveling at the view.<br><br>If you haven’t written any or many songs, this course will show you
an efficient, effective process for tailoring songs to express your ideas and
emotions. If you have, you’ll look at your process differently, taking control
of aspects of the process you may have not noticed.<br><br>The course will start by examining the tools available to you, all
revolving around the essential concept of <i>prosody</i>. You’ll learn to use your
tools to enhance your message—to work compositionally at the same time you’re
developing your ideas.<br><br>You’ll be working both lyrically and musically, though
musically it’s not necessary that you either read music or play an instrument.
If you play, great, and you’ll be encouraged to play and record your musical
responses to the assignments. If you don’t play, the course offers you a number
of musical loops to work with. All you’ll have to do is sing your melodies over
the loops.<br><br>Assignments will ask you to post something for peer review—sometimes lyric lines or sections, sometimes
melodies, sometimes both. None of it has to be polished. The course is about writing,
not performing.<br><br>Most important, you’ll have a lot of fun.

Title:  Physics 1 for Physical Science Majors
Short desc:  This is a 12 week course, currently scheduled to start on Monday, April 14, 2014 and finishing on Friday, July 11.  This introductory physics course is intended for physical science majors and others desiring a rigorous introduction to physics. It closely parallels the brick-and-mortar course given to the freshmen at the University of Colorado at Boulder. The course covers classical mechanics, including kinematics, dynamics, conservation laws, and applications. 
Long desc:  <p>This course is a rigorous introduction to classical mechanics, which is the study of forces and motion.  How does gravity control the motion of the
planets around the sun or the motion of a projectile fired from a cannon?  Why does a spinning skater spin faster when
she pulls her arms in?  Why is a
perpetual motion machine impossible? These are the kinds of questions which can
be answered with classical mechanics, which was first formulated by Isaac
Newton around 1666. Classical, or Newtonian Mechanics is the oldest branch of
physics, but it will never go out of style. 
It remains the foundation of our understanding of the physical world and
is constantly used by engineers and scientists. There is a space probe, called
New Horizons, that is on its way to Pluto right now, and it will arrive on July
14, 2015, exactly on time and on target, because its path has been computed
using classical mechanics, and nothing
more.</p>

Title:  Web Application Architectures
Short desc:  Learn how to build and deploy modern web application architectures – applications that run over the Internet, in the "cloud," using a browser as the user interface.
Long desc:  <b>This course explores the development of web application architectures from an engineering perspective.</b>&nbsp; We will consider the fundamental design patterns and philosophies associated with modern web application architectures, along with their major components. &nbsp;By the end of this course, I expect you to be able to:<br><ul><li><b></b><b></b><b></b><b></b><b>Design, develop and deploy a modern web application. </b>&nbsp;This course is <i>not</i> about how to build a pretty web page, it's about how to build and deploy the full stack of protocols and technologies associated with a complete web app. &nbsp;That said, it is not possible for you to become an expert in this area in a few weeks. My goal, rather, is to put you on the right path by providing a solid foundation and framework for understanding web applications, allowing you to dig deeper and learn more on your own. The next bullet points describe how we're going to do this.</li><li><b>Understand the major architectural components in web apps, and how they fit together.</b> &nbsp;Modern web apps are complex. &nbsp;A typical application has a database along with numerous scripts on one end of the web stack, a web server in the middle that delivers information over the Internet, and a user's browser on the other end of the web stack. &nbsp;Even getting started in trying to understand these components can be overwhelming. Consider just the programming languages involved in a typical web stack: from the database (SQL), to the web server (scripting language), to the browser (JavaScript, HTML, CSS), we're dealing with five different programming languages, not to mention the protocols they're operating over

















–&nbsp;and you need to know a little about them too! We'll introduce a number of software design patterns throughout the course that are aimed at helping you to manage this complexity.</li><li><b>Use Ruby on Rails.</b> &nbsp;We're going to learn about web apps through the Ruby on Rails framework.&nbsp;

















Rails is a framework for creating web
applications that is built on top of the Ruby programming language.&nbsp;I believe this is one of the best frameworks
for learning about web applications, and it's also proving highly successful as
a platform for commercial offerings.&nbsp;
That said, there are many other frameworks available, and the concepts
you will learn using Rails are transferable to these other frameworks.</li><li>














<b>Better understand modern software engineering
practice.&nbsp; </b>We’ll be using the latest tools and practices in
software development, source code control, testing, and application
deployment.&nbsp;This will include exposure
to agile development practices, the numerous tools that software engineers are expected to know how to use, and the cloud-based resources that are
becoming increasingly important in web applications.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li></ul>

Title:  Content Strategy for Professionals: Engaging Audiences for Your Organization
Short desc:  This professional Content Strategy MOOC is for people anywhere in an organization who have content development experience and now want to significantly improve their abilities to understand audiences and develop strategic words, pictures, graphics, and videos to convey their organization’s most important goals.
Long desc:  Why Content Strategy is essential for professionals in any organization – business,
non-profit, or government.
<br>
<br>Content Strategy is a conversation that provides thought-leadership. It
starts a “conversation” with users and stakeholders inside and outside
an organization.  Conversations are the natural way people think about
complex issues. Conversations also enable people to develop “stories,”
which lead to understanding and helpful mental pictures. Content Strategy
practitioners are at all levels of the best enterprises – in all departments
and sectors from the top leader to the newcomer in the ranks.
<br>
<br>In this complex information age, forward-thinking employees know that
if they and their organizations are to thrive, they need to go beyond their
job descriptions. They must master the most demanding communications frontier
– creating engaging, strategic, honest stories and information that is
valued by their most important audiences. In turn that will make their
enterprise stand out.
<br>
<br>Regardless of their department, area of work, or expertise, Content Strategy
practitioners know how to use words, pictures, video, and social and mobile
media to interact with their most important constituents with trustable,
actionable information that the audience values and will use. The strategic
content they produce enhances the audience’s lives and deepens their
understanding and engagement with the organization.
<br>
<br>Content Strategy is similar to the best examples of journalism, but it
is done by non-journalism organizations. Content Strategy is always honest,
trustable, and transparent. It tells all sides of every story it reports.
Often it is also deeper and directed at topics and audiences that traditional
journalism under-serves or does not reach at all. Content Strategy is not
advertising, marketing, or public relations. It is different because it
never pursues the persuasive goals that are appropriate in those disciplines.

non-profit, or government.
<br>
<br>Content Strategy is a conversation that provides thought-leadership. It
starts a “conversation” with users and stakeholders inside and outside
an organization.  Conversations are the natural way people think about
complex issues. Conversations also enable people to develop “stories,”
which lead to understanding and helpful mental pictures. Content Strategy
practitioners are at all levels of the best enterprises – in all departments
and sectors from the top leader to the newcomer in the ranks.
<br>
<br>In this complex information age, forward-thinking employees know that
if they and their organizations are to thrive, they need to go beyond their
job descriptions. They must master the most demanding communications frontier
– creating engaging, strategic, honest stories and information that is
valued by their most important audiences. In turn that will make their
enterprise stand out.
<br>
<br>Regardless of their department, area of work, or expertise, Content Strategy
practitioners know how to use words, pictures, video, and social and mobile
media to interact with their most important constituents with trustable,
actionable information that the audience values and will use. The strategic
content they produce enhances the audience’s lives and deepens their
understanding and engagement with the organization.
<br>
<br>Content Strategy is similar to the best examples of journalism, but it
is done by non-journalism organizations. Content Strategy is always honest,
trustable, and transparent. It tells all sides of every story it reports.
Often it is also deeper and directed at topics and audiences that traditional
journalism under-serves or does not reach at all. Content Strategy is not
advertising, marketing, or public relations. It is different because it
never pursues the persuasive goals that are appropriate in those disciplines.

Title:  The Brain and Space
Short desc:  This course is about how detective work by the brain creates our sense of spatial location from a variety of sensory and motor sources, and how this spatial sense in turn shapes our cognitive abilities.
Long desc:  <p>Knowing where things are is effortless.  But “under the hood,” your brain devotes a tremendous amount of computational power to figuring out even the simplest of details about the world around you and your position in it.  Recognizing your mother, finding your phone, going to the grocery store, playing the banjo – these require careful sleuthing and coordination across different sensory and motor domains.  This course traces the brain’s detective work to create this sense of space and argues that the brain’s spatial focus permeates our cognitive abilities, affecting the way we think and remember.</p>
<p>The material in this course overlaps with that normally covered in classes on perception or systems neuroscience.<br></p>

Title:  Introduction to Genetics and Evolution
Short desc:  A whirlwind introduction to evolution and genetics, from basic principles to current applications, including how disease genes are mapped and how we leverage evolutionary concepts to aid humanity.
Long desc:  Introduction to Genetics and Evolution is a college-level class being offered simultaneously to new students at <a target="_blank" href="http://biology.duke.edu/">Duke University</a>. The course gives interested people a very basic overview of some principles behind these very fundamental areas of biology.  We often hear about new "genome sequences," commercial kits that can tell you about your ancestry (including pre-human) from your DNA or disease predispositions, debates about the truth of evolution, why animals behave the way they do, and how people found "genetic evidence for natural selection."  This course provides the basic biology you need to understand all of these issues better, tries to clarify some misconceptions, and tries to prepare students for future, more advanced coursework in Biology.  No prior coursework is assumed.<br><br>

Title:  Financing and Investing in Infrastructure
Short desc:  Learn how debt and equity can be used to finance infrastructure investments and how investors approach infrastructure investments.
Long desc:  <p>According
to the OECD, the total global infrastructure investment requirement by 2030 for
transport, electricity generation, transmission and distribution, water and
telecommunications comes to $71tn. This figure represents about 3.5% of the
annual World GDP from 2007 to 2030.</p><p>The
European Commission estimated that, by 2020, Europe will need between euro 1.5tn
and euro 2tn of infrastructure investments. In the time period between 2011 and
2020, about euro 500bn will be required for the implementation of the
Trans-European Transport Network (TEN-T) programme, euro 400bn for Energy
distribution networks and smart grids, euro 200 bn on Energy transmission
networks and storage and euro 500bn for the upgrade and construction of new
power plants. An additional euro 38-58bn and euro 181-268bn capital investment
will be needed to achieve the targets set by the European Commission for broadband
diffusion.<br></p><p>Traditionally, investments in infrastructure were financed using public sources. However, severe budget constraints and inefficient management of infrastructure by public entities have led to an increased involvement of private investors in the business. <br></p><p>The course focuses on how private investors approach infrastructure projects from the standpoints of equity, debt and hybrid instruments. <br></p>

<p>The course is concentrated on the practical aspects of project finance, the most frequently used financial technique for infrastructure investments. The repeated use of real life examples and case studies allows students to link the theoretical
background to actual business practice.</p>

<p>At the end of the course, students will be in the position to analyze a
complex transaction, to identify key elements of the deal and to suggest proper
solutions for deal structuring from the perspective of a financial advisor.</p>

Title:  Metadata: Organizing and Discovering Information
Short desc:  Metadata is an unsung hero of the modern world, the plumbing that makes the information age possible. This course describes how Metadata is used as an information tool for the Web, for databases, and for the software and computing applications around us.
Long desc:  If you use nearly any digital technology, you make use of metadata. Use
an ATM today? You interacted with metadata about your account. Searched
for songs in iTunes or Spotify? You used metadata about those songs. We
use and even create metadata constantly, but we rarely realize it. Metadata
-- or data about data -- describes real and digital objects, so that those
objects may be organized now and found later.
<br>
<br>Metadata is a tool that enables the information age functions performed
by humans as well as those performed by computers. Metadata is important
to many fields, particularly Computer Science; but this course is not purely
a Computer Science course. This course approaches Metadata from the perspective
of Information Science, which is a broad interdisciplinary field that studies
how people create and manage information.

Title:  Internet History, Technology, and Security
Short desc:  What is the Internet? How was it created? How does it work?  How do we secure communications on the Internet?
Long desc:  The impact of technology and networks on our lives, culture, and society continues to increase. The very fact that you can take this course from anywhere in the world requires a technological infrastructure that was designed, engineered, and built over the past sixty years. To function in an information-centric world, we need to understand the workings of network technology. This course will open up the Internet and show you how it was created, who created it and how it works. Along the way we will meet many of the innovators who developed the Internet and Web technologies that we use today. <br><br>
<h2>What You Will Learn</h2>
After this course you will not take the Internet and Web for granted. You will be better informed about important technological issues currently facing society. You will realize that the Internet and Web are spaces for innovation and you will get a better understanding of how you might fit into that innovation. If you get excited about the material in this course, it is a great lead-in to taking a course in Web design, Web development, programming, or even network administration. At a minimum, you will be a much wiser network citizen.<br>

Title:  Greek and Roman Mythology
Short desc:  This course will focus on the myths of ancient Greece and Rome, as a way of exploring the nature of myth and the function it plays for individuals, societies, and nations.
Long desc:  Myths are traditional stories that have endured over a long time. Some
of them have to do with events of great importance, such as the founding
of a nation. Others tell the stories of great heroes and heroines and their
exploits and courage in the face of adversity. Still others are simple
tales about otherwise unremarkable people who get into trouble or do some
great deed. What are we to make of all these tales, and why do people seem
to like to hear them? This course will focus on the myths of ancient Greece
and Rome, as a way of exploring the nature of myth and the function it
plays for individuals, societies, and nations. We will also pay some attention
to the way the Greeks and Romans themselves understood their own myths.
Are myths subtle codes that contain some universal truth? Are they a window
on the deep recesses of a particular culture? Are they a set of blinders
that all of us wear, though we do not realize it? Or are they just entertaining
stories that people like to tell over and over? This course will investigate
these questions through a variety of topics, including the creation of
the universe, the relationship between gods and mortals, human nature,
religion, the family, sex, love, madness, and death.

Title:  Sustainable Food Production Through Livestock Health Management
Short desc:  Learn about the impact of infectious disease on sustainable animal-based food production by understanding the science of growth, immunity, and infection and by learning the problem-solving skills needed to advance animal health and food production through optimal management practices.
Long desc:  <p>There is a growing global need in agricultural production for a workforce that is capable of integrating knowledge of animal health and production with an understanding of consumer preferences in the context of economic reality, business efficiency, and
ethical constraint.  However, current evidence suggests that there is a growing shortage of people with the knowledge and problem-solving skills required to match the rapid advances being made in animal health, science, and food production. 
The results of this shortage are wide-ranging and could lead to challenges in food security and agricultural economic competitiveness in some countries.</p><p>In this course we will explore the effect of infectious disease on sustainable animal-based food production. The content and learning outcomes of this new course will be designed to be relevant across different food production sectors (i.e., beef, dairy, poultry,
    and pigs). While the instructors will provide the participants with a strong scientific base for understanding the impact of infectious disease in animal-based food production, the emphasis of the material will be on practical problem-solving and
will be    directed towards equipping participants with a platform for developing the skills needed to contribute to sustainable food production.</p>
